Keep your LightNet site up to date by following these steps:

<Steps>
1. Check your dependencies by running
    ```bash
    npm outdated
    ```
2. Read the release notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/lightnetdev/lightnet/releases) {/*there are hardly any notes on the page...*/}
3. Update your dependencies by running
    ```bash
    npm update
    ```
    This updates your dependencies to the latest version according to the [version specifiers](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-update) 
    inside `package.json`.
4. If there are any breaking changes, you need to update your code to match the new API. Also update the dependencies to the 
    latest version inside `package.json`. When you are done, run `npm install` to install the new dependencies. 
    {/*will there be any notes or help on doing so? - where?*/}
</Steps>

<Aside>
LightNet follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). This means you can update your dependencies to the latest minor 
version without breaking your site.
