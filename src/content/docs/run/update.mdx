Keep your LightNet site up to date by following these steps:

<Steps>
1. Check your dependencies by running
    ```bash
    npm outdated
    ```
2. Read the release notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/lightnetdev/lightnet/releases)
3. Update your dependencies by running
    ```bash
    npm update
    ```
    This will update your dependencies to the latest version according to the [version specifiers](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-update) inside `package.json`.
4. If there are any breaking changes, you will need to update your code to match the new API. Also update the dependencies to the latest version inside `package.json`.
   When you are done, run `npm install` to install the new dependencies.
</Steps>

<Aside>
LightNet follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). This means you can update your dependencies to the latest minor version without breaking your site.
