## Configure the `lightnet` integration

LightNet is an integration built on top of the [Astro](https://astro.build/) web framework.
You can configure the integration in your `astro.config.mjs` file.

```js title="astro.config.mjs"
import lightnet from "lightnet";
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";

export default defineConfig({
  site: "https://yourdomain.com",
  integrations: [
    lightnet({
      title: "Your Site's Name",
    }),
  ],
});
```

You can pass the following options to the `lightnet` integration:

### `title`

type: `string` \
example: `"Your Site's Name"` \
required: `true`

The title of your site. This will be used as the title of the site and the header bar.
It can be a fixed string or a translation key to support multiple locales.

### `languages`

type: `array` \
example: `[{ code: "en", label: "English", translations: {}, isDefaultUILanguage: true }]` \
required: `true`

The languages of your site. This will be used to support multiple locales and content languages.

#### `languages.code`

type: `string` \
example: `"en"` \
required: `true`

The [IETF BCP-47](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) code of the language. This code will be used as the language's identifier.

#### `languages.label`

type: `string` \
example: `"English"` \
required: `true`

The name of the language. This will be used as the language name in the UI. It can be a fixed string or a translation key to support multiple locales.

#### `languages.isUILanguage`

type: `boolean` \
example: `true` \
required: `false`

Configure this language to be available as a user interface language. It will show up in the language picker in the menu bar.
You do not need to set this, if you set `isDefaultUILanguage` to true.

#### `languages.isDefaultUILanguage`

type: `boolean` \
example: `true` \
required: `false`

If you set this to `true`, the language will be used as the default user interface language.
You must set exactly one language to `true`. The default user interface language is used:

- As the fallback language if a translation is not available for the current locale.
- As the default language when the user navigates to the root URL.

### `logo`

type: `object` \
example: `{ src: "./src/assets/logo.png" }` \
required: `false`

The logo of your site to be shown in the header bar next to the site title.

#### `logo.src`

type: `string` \
example: `"./src/assets/logo.png"` \
required: `true`

The path to the logo image. Provide a path to an image inside `src/assets`. Supported formats include `jpg`, `png`, `svg` and `webp`.  
LightNet optimizes the image size for better performance (except for SVGs). We recommend providing a image file with a width and height of 150px.

#### `logo.alt`

type: `string` \
example: `"x.logo.alt"` \
required: `false`

The alt text of the logo. This will be used if the logo image is not available or if the user has disabled images. For example when using a screen reader.
The value of the `alt` attribute can either be a fixed string or a translation key to support multiple locales.

#### `logo.size`

type: `number` \
example: `30` \
required: `false`

The size of the logo in the header bar in pixels. This will be applied to the shorter side of the logo image.

### `favicon`

type: `array` \
example: `[{ rel: "icon", href: "favicon.ico" }]` \
required: `false`

The favicon of your site. This will be used as the favicon of the site. Favicon is a small icon displayed in the browser tab and bookmarks.

Our API supports multiple favicon formats. Each entry in the `favicon` array maps to an HTML `<link>` element. For example:

Input:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" {2-8}
lightnet({
  favicon: [
    {
      rel: "icon",
      href: "favicon.ico",
      sizes: "32x32",
    },
  ],
});
```

Maps to the following HTML:

```html {2}
<head>
  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico" sizes="32x32" />
</head>
```

<Aside>
  LightNet automatically determines the `type` attribute based on the file
  extension in the `href`.
</Aside>

#### `favicon.href`

type: `string` \
example: `"/favicon.svg"` \
required: `true`

Reference the favicon. This must be a path to an image in the `public/` directory.

#### `favicon.rel`

type: `"icon" | "apple-touch-icon"` \
example: `"icon"` \
required: `false` \
default: `"icon"`

The rel attribute of the favicon. This will be used to set the rel attribute of the favicon.
Refer to the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#attr-rel) for more information.

#### `favicon.sizes`

type: `string` \
example: `"32x32"` \
required: `false`

The sizes attribute of the favicon. This will be used to set the sizes attribute of the favicon.
Refer to the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#attr-sizes) for more information.

### `manifest`

type: `string` \
example: `"/manifest.json"` \
required: `false`

The path to the manifest file. This will be used to set the manifest of the site. The file is expected to be in the `public/` directory.

<Aside>
  The manifest is a JSON file that describes the site and its capabilities. More
  information can be found in the [MDN
  documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest).
</Aside>

### `mainMenu`

type: `array` \
example: `[{ href: "/about", label: "x.navigation.about" }]` \
required: `false`

The main menu of the site. This will be used to set the main menu of the site. It is expected to be an array with at least one entry.
Each entry is an object with the following properties:

#### `mainMenu.href`

type: `string` \
example: `"/about"` \
required: `true`

The link attribute of the main menu entry. The value can be a relative URL or an absolute URL.

#### `mainMenu.label`

type: `string` \
example: `"x.navigation.about"` \
required: `true`

The label of the main menu entry. The value can be a fixed string or a translation key to support multiple locales.

#### `mainMenu.requiresLocale`

type: `boolean` \
example: `false` \
required: `false` \
default: `true`

Relative URLs are by default prefixed with the current locale (e.g., `/media` becomes `/en/media` for English).  
To disable this, set `requiresLocale` property to `false`.

This option will be ignored if the path is absolute (e.g. `https://wikipedia.org`).

### `internalDomains`

type: `array` \
example: `["files.your-domain.com"]` \
required: `false`

The internal domains of the site. This will be used to determine if a link is internal or external.

For example if you want to link to files on your subdomain `files.your-domain.com`, you can add it to the `internalDomains` array.
Your link to `https://files.your-domain.com/file.pdf` won't show up as an external link in the UI.

### `searchPage`

type: `object` \
example: `{ filterByLocale: true }` \
required: `false`

Search page related settings.

#### `searchPage.filterByLocale`

type: `boolean` \
example: `true` \
required: `false` \
default: `false`

If you set this to `true`, the search page will be initially filtered by the current UI language.
The filter will only be set when there is any media item in the current language.

## Configure the `decapAdmin` integration

LightNet Decap Admin is an Astro integration built on top of the [Decap CMS](https://decap-cms.org/) headless CMS.
You can configure the integration in your `astro.config.mjs` file.

```js title="astro.config.mjs" {8-10}
import lightnet from "lightnet";
import decapAdmin from "@lightnet/decap-admin";
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    lightnet({...})
    decapAdmin({
      languages: [{...}],
    }),
  ],
});
```

You can pass the following options to the `decapAdmin` integration:

### `languages`

type: `array` \
example: `[{ code: "en", label: "English", translations: {}, isDefaultUILanguage: true }]` \
required: `true`

The languages of your site. This will be used to support multiple locales and content languages.
You should use the same languages as in the `lightnet` integration. We recommend creating a shared variable that is used in both integrations.
See the [lightnet configuration](#languages) for more information on the languages structure.

### `path`

type: `string` \
example: `"admin"` \
required: `false` \
default: `"admin"`

The path to the admin page.

### `imagesFolder`

type: `string` \
example: `"images"` \
required: `false` \
default: `"images"`

The name of the images folder next to your content files. Change this if you want to use a different name for the images folder.
For example if your images stored inside a folder `src/content/media/covers`, you can set this to `"covers"`.

### `backend`

type: `object` \
example: `{ name: "gitlab", repo: "your-org/your-site", appId: "12345abcd" }` \
required: `false`

This configures the git host that your Administration UI is connected to. Currently we support GitLab and GitHub backends.
The configuration directly maps (replacing snake_case with camelCase) to the Decap CMS [GitHub](https://decapcms.org/docs/github-backend) and [GitLab](https://decapcms.org/docs/gitlab-backend) backend configuration.

<Aside type="tip">
  We recommend using the GitLab backend for LightNet sites.
</Aside>

#### `backend: "gitlab"`

GitLab backend configuration has this options:

- **name**: `"gitlab"` (required) this selects the GitLab backend.
- **repo**: `string` (required) the GitLab repository path of your site.
- **appId**: `string` Application ID from the sites GitLab settings. Our [guide on the Administration UI](/content/administration-ui#connect-to-gitlab) shows how to get this.
- **branch**: `string` the branch that is used for the Administration UI. Default is `"main"`.
- **authType**: `"pkce"` the authentication type to use. Default and only option is `"pkce"`.

#### `backend: "github"`

GitHub backend configuration has this options:

- **name**: `"github"` (required) this selects the GitHub backend.
- **repo**: `string` (required) the GitHub repository path of your site.
- **branch**: `string` the branch that is used for the Administration UI. Default is `"main"`.
- **baseUrl**: `string` the URL of your service doing the authentication request.

<Aside>
GitHub does not support the PKCE authentication type. This means that you will need an authentication server to handle the authentication request.
This is why we recommend using the GitLab backend for LightNet sites.

See the [Decap CMS documentation](https://decapcms.org/docs/backends-overview#using-github-with-an-oauth-proxy)
for more information on how to create an authentication server for GitHub.
