title: Components Reference
---

LightNet provides a set of components that you can use to build your pages.
These components can be used to customize the homepage or other custom Astro pages.

This is the layout of a LightNet page:

```astro title="example.astro"
---
import { Page } from "lightnet/components"
---
<Page>
    {/* Add components here */}
</Page>
```

The `Page` component handles the layout of the page. This will add the header, language switcher, menu system...

The components are expected to be placed inside the `Page` component.
This reference gives you an overview of all available components. You import them from `lightnet/components`.

## Available components

### Hero

The `Hero` component is used to display a hero image with a page title and a subtitle.

### Section

```astro title="example.astro"
---
import { Section } from "lightnet/components"

A `Section` will grow its width with the screen size. It will stop growing according to the `maxWidth` property.
After this it will be centered on the screen. The `maxWidth` property can be set to `full` or `prose`.

  the section to the left and right side of the header bar's content. The `full` width should be used on the homepage.
- `prose`: The section will stop growing so that contained text is still well readable. This is the width used on the details page.

required: `false`
