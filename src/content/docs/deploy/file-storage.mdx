Cloudflare Pages puts a limit of 25 MB on your file sizes. If you need to store larger files, we recommend using Backblaze.

Here is how to use it:

<Aside type="caution">
We recommend keeping your file sizes as small as possible to provide a good user experience.

<Steps>
1. **Create a Backblaze Account**: Sign up at [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com).
2. **Create a Backblaze Bucket**: In the Backblaze dashboard, create a new bucket and upload your files.
3. **Reference Your Backblaze URL**: Use the URL of the uploaded file as the media item's content URL in your LightNet site.
4. **Configure Internal Domains**: Add your Backblaze domain to the internal domains configuration in `astro.config.mjs` to ensure proper handling of the files.
    ```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={3}
    export default defineConfig({
      // ...
      internalDomains: ["your-backblaze-domain.com"],
    });
    ```
</Steps>


<Aside type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
You can also use Cloudflare to proxy requests to your Backblaze bucket. By doing so, you can 
use a custom subdomain on your file urls e.g. `https://files.your-ministry.com/a-book-about-love.pdf`.
