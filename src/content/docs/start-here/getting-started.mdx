Welcome to the LightNet Library Developer Documentation! LightNet Library allows you to build customizable media distribution websites. This guide will walk you through setting up your environment and creating your first project.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following are installed on your machine:

1. **Node.js** (version 22 or higher) â€“ [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
2. **Git** â€“ [Download Git](https://git-scm.com)
3. **Text Editor** â€“ We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the official [Astro extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.astro-vscode).

To verify your installations, run the following commands:

```bash
node -v
git --version
```

If these commands return version numbers, you're ready to go!


## Step 1: Set Up the Sk8 Ministries Example

We recommend starting with the [Sk8 Ministries example](https://sk8-ministries.pages.dev/), a prebuilt template that showcases LightNet Libraryâ€™s features. Itâ€™s a great starting point for learning how to structure your media site.

To create a local copy of the project, run:

```bash
npm create astro@latest -- --template LightNetDev/lightnet-library/examples/sk8-ministries
```

Follow the setup wizard to:

- Choose a name for your project.
- Install dependencies.
- Optionally, initialize a Git repository.

Once finished, navigate into your project folder:

```bash
cd your-project-name
```


## Step 2: Run the Development Server

Now that your project is set up, start the development server to see your site in action:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your site will be available at [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321). Open it in your browser to preview the example site.


## Step 3: Make Your First Modification

As your first modification, letâ€™s change the site title:

<Steps>
1. Open `src/translations/en.json` in a text editor.
2. Modify the value of the `custom.site.title` key by changing "Sk8 Ministry" to your desired site name.
3. Save the file. Still running `npm run dev`, your browser will automatically refresh to show the updated title.
</Steps>

### Optional Next Step: Make another Modification using the Administration UI

You can easily update content using the Administration UI. Follow these steps:

<Steps>
1. Ensure that `npm run dev` is still running in your terminal.
2. Open a new terminal window in your project root and execute `npx decap-server`. This command will download and start a backend for Decap CMS, which is used for the content Administration UI.
3. Once you see the message `info: Decap CMS Proxy Server listening on port 8081` in your terminal, open your browser and navigate to [localhost:4321/admin](http://localhost:4321/admin).
4. Click the "Login" button. You will be presented with a list of all available media items.
5. Locate and select `how-to-360-flip--en`. Change the title to "How to Do a 360 Flip".
6. Click the "Publish" button in the header bar, then select "Publish Now".
</Steps>

<Aside>
This action will update the JSON content file stored on your computer. Additionally, the Administration UI can integrate with a git host like [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com) for internet access.
</Aside>

#### Inspect changes

<Steps>
1. **Check the Updated Content File**: Open the file located at `/src/content/media/how-to-360-flip--en.json`. The `title` attribute should reflect your changes.
2. **View the Updated Website**: In your browser, go to [localhost:4321/en/media/how-to-360-flip--en](http://localhost:4321/en/media/how-to-360-flip--en). You should see the updated title displayed below the video.
</Steps>

Feel free to experiment further by adding new media items through the Administration UI or by creating additional JSON files.


## Step 4: Build and Deploy Your Site

When you're ready to deploy your site, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates a `dist` folder with static HTML files that are ready to be deployed to any server.
