Welcome to the LightNet Developer Documentation! LightNet allows you to build customizable media distribution websites. This guide will walk you through setting up your environment and creating your first project.
Not yet sure, what LightNet is all about? [Visit the LightNet homepage](https://lightnet.community).

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following are installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (version 22 or higher) â€“ [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- **Git** â€“ [Download Git](https://git-scm.com)
- **Text Editor** â€“ We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the official [Astro extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.astro-vscode).

To verify your installations, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
git -v
```

If these commands return version numbers, you're ready to go!

## 1. Set Up the Sk8 Ministries Example

We recommend starting with the [Sk8 Ministries example](https://sk8-ministries.pages.dev/), a prebuilt template that showcases LightNet's features. It's a great starting point for learning how to structure your media site.

To create a local copy of the project -  navigate your terminal to a folder where you would like to create the copy and run:

```bash
npm create astro@latest -- --template LightNetDev/LightNet/examples/sk8-ministries
```

This command starts [Astro's](https://astro.build) setup wizard. In this wizard:

- Choose a location for your project. This will create the folder for your project and also set its name.
- Install its dependencies (`Yes`).
- Initialize a Git repository (`Yes`).

Once finished, navigate into your project folder:

```bash
cd your-project-folder
```

## 2. Run the Development Server

Now that your project is set up, start the development server to see your site in action.
The development server is an application that lets you preview your media site in your browser without putting it online.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your site will be available at [localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321). Open your browser to preview the example site.
As you will need the development server for the next steps, please keep it running.

## 3. Make Your First Modification

As your first modification, let's change the site title:

<Steps>
  1. Open the project folder in VS-Code (our your preferred editor).
  1. Inside VS-Code open `src/translations/en.yml`. 
  1. Modify the value of the `x.site.title`-key by changing "Sk8 Ministries" to your desired site name.
  1. Save the file. Still running `npm run dev`, your browser will automatically
  refresh to show the updated title. It will be visible in front of the big picture and inside the header bar.
</Steps>

### Optional: Make another Modification using the Administration UI

You can easily update content using the Administration UI. The 
Administration UI is a graphical user interface that enables a content manager to update the media site's content without
accessing the source code. Follow these steps to run the Administration UI:

<Steps>
  1. Ensure that `npm run dev` is still running in your terminal. 
  2. Open a new terminal window on your project's root folder and execute the following command. This
     command will download and start a backend for Decap CMS, which is used for the
     content Administration UI.
      ```bash
      npx decap-server
      ```
  3. Once you see the message `info: Decap CMS Proxy Server listening on port 8081` in your terminal, open your browser and
     navigate to the Administration UI on [localhost:4321/admin](http://localhost:4321/admin). 
  4. Click the "Login" button. You will be presented with a list of all available media
     items. 
  5. Open `how-to-360-flip--en` by clicking it. Change the title to "How to
  Do a 360 Flip". 
  6. Click the "Publish" button in the header bar, then select
  "Publish Now".
</Steps>

{/* todo: link json content file to explanation, link admin ui to guide  */}

This action will update the a JSON content file stored on inside your local project folder.
Additionally, the Administration UI can integrate with a git host like
[gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com) to be accessed online. Later you will learn how to do this.

Inspect the changes you have just made:

<Steps>
  1. **Check the Updated Content File**: Open the file located at
  `/src/content/media/how-to-360-flip--en.json`. The `title` attribute should
  reflect your changes. 
  2. **View the Updated Website**: In your browser, go to
  [localhost:4321/en/media/how-to-360-flip--en](http://localhost:4321/en/media/how-to-360-flip--en).
  You should see the updated title displayed below the video.
</Steps>

Feel free to experiment further by adding new media items through the Administration UI or by creating additional JSON files.


## What's Next?

Great job! ðŸŽ‰ You've successfully set up a media site running locally. Now, let's dive deeper into how LightNet works and explore more advanced customization options.
