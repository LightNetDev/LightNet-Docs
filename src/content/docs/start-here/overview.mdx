LightNet enables you to run your own web-based media distribution site, allowing you to publish curated content tailored to the language and culture of the communities you serve. This includes a variety of media types such as books, videos, audio, images, and more.

## Our Design Goals

LightNet is designed with the following goals in mind:

- **Reusable Solution**: Build sites that require minimal coding.
- **Cost-Effective**: Keep operational costs low.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy to set up, modify, run, and maintain.
- **Privacy-Focused**: No tracking and no advertising.
- **Multilingual Support**: Easily translate into other languages, including right-to-left languages.
- **Accessibility**: Function effectively in areas with poor internet access or on older devices.
- **Security**: Protect against hacking attempts.

## How It Works

LightNet Library integrates with the [Astro](https://astro.build) framework. It transforms a folder containing configuration files, content files, and HTML files into a deployable folder containing HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

### Key Features

- **Pre-rendering**: HTML is pre-rendered as much as possible to reduce traffic and improve load times.
- **Static Output**: LightNet Library generates only static files, eliminating the need to maintain a running backend site.
- **Content Management**: Website content can be edited as JSON files, or you can opt to use an administration interface that connects to a Git repository host, such as [GitLab](https://gitlab.com).

With LightNet, you can create a robust media distribution site that meets the needs of your community while ensuring ease of use and security.

## Limitations: What LightNet Does Not Provide

While LightNet offers a robust solution for web-based media distribution, it is important to understand its limitations. Here are some aspects that LightNet does not address:

- **User Authentication**: LightNet does not include built-in user authentication or account management features. There is no option to restrict access to specific media items.

- **Advanced Analytics**: LightNet lacks advanced analytics and tracking capabilities. If you require detailed user behavior tracking or analytics, you will need to integrate third-party services.

- **E-commerce Functionality**: LightNet is not designed for e-commerce sites. If you need shopping cart functionality, payment processing, or inventory management, you will need to use a separate platform.

- **Complex Interactivity**: While LightNet supports basic interactivity through JavaScript, it cannot provide features that require a server to store user data. This means it does not support user comments or personalization features that sync across browsers.

Understanding these limitations will help you make informed decisions about whether LightNet is the right fit for your project and what additional tools or services you may need to implement.

# Project Structure

LightNet Library is a [Astro Integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/). As a result, 
all LightNet Library projects are structured based on the Astro project layout. 
To learn more about the Astro project structure, please refer to 
the [Astro Documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/). In the following section, 
we will explain the structure used by LightNet Library.

## Directory Layout

<FileTree>
- public/
- src/
  - assets/
  - content/
  - pages/
  - translations/
- tailwind.config.mjs
- package.json
- astro.config.mjs
- tsconfig.json
</FileTree>

### Directory and File Descriptions

- **`public/`**: This directory contains static assets that are served directly by the web server. It is used for files that are published with your library, such as PDFs and MP3s.
- **`src/`**: This is the main source directory where you will develop your site.
  - **`assets/`**: A subdirectory for images, fonts referenced by your pages.
  - **`content/`**: A directory for content files, such as JSON or Markdown files, that hold the data for your site. This is where you can [manage your media items and other content](/add-content/understand-content).
  - **`pages/`**: This directory holds the individual pages of your site. Each file in this directory typically corresponds to a route in your site. You will need this folder to [customize your homepage](/build/customize-home) or [add custom pages](/build/add-custom-pages).
  - **`translations`**: This directory contains translation files for the user interface (UI). You learn more about translations in the chapter on [Internationalization](/build/internationalization).
- **`tailwind.config.mjs`**: This file configures the styling of the website using the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework. You can use it to extend styles and customize aspects such as the primary color of your site.
- **`package.json`**: The file that manages your project's dependencies and scripts. It includes metadata about your project, such as its name, version, and the libraries it depends on.
- **`astro.config.mjs`**: The main configuration file for your Astro project. This is where lot of LightNet Library [configurations](/build/configurations) are done.
