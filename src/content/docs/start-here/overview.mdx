LightNet empowers communities to access curated media through a customizable, web-based distribution platform. Designed with accessibility and privacy in mind, it supports diverse content types such as books, videos, audio, and images, tailored to your audience's language and culture.

## Design Goals

LightNet is built with the following principles:

- **Reusable Solution**: Create media distribution sites with minimal coding.
- **Cost-Effective**: Keep operational expenses low for sustainability.
- **User-Friendly**: Simplify setup, modification, and maintenance.
- **Privacy-Focused**: Ensure no tracking or advertisements.
- **Multilingual Support**: Translate easily, including support for right-to-left languages.
- **Accessible**: Operate efficiently on low-bandwidth connections and older devices.
- **Secure**: Protect against common hacking attempts.

## How It Works

The **LightNet Library** transforms a folder of configuration files, content, HTML, and JavaScript into a fully deployable package of static assets (HTML, CSS, and JS).

Built as a plugin for the [Astro framework](https://astro.build), LightNet uses Astro´s static site generation capabilities to simplify media distribution. To get the most out of LightNet, we recommend exploring the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/).

### Key Features

- **Pre-rendered HTML**: Reduces traffic and improves load times.
- **Static Output**: Generates static files, removing the need for backend servers.
- **Flexible Content Management**: Edit content as JSON or use an admin interface that integrates with [GitLab](https://gitlab.com).

With LightNet, you can create a robust, efficient media site to serve your community’s needs.

## Scope and Limitations

While LightNet is a powerful tool, it does not include:

- **User Authentication**: No built-in user accounts or access restrictions.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Integrate third-party tools for detailed tracking.
- **E-commerce Support**: Shopping carts and payment processing are not supported.
- **Complex Interactivity**: Server-side features like comments or personalized user experiences are unavailable.

These design choices keep LightNet lightweight and focused on its core purpose: static media distribution.

## Project Structure

LightNet projects follow the [Astro project layout](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/). Below is an example directory structure:

<FileTree>
- public/
- src/
  - assets/
  - content/
  - pages/
  - translations/
- tailwind.config.mjs
- package.json
- astro.config.mjs
- tsconfig.json
</FileTree>

### Directory Overview

- **`public/`**: Static files (e.g., PDFs, MP3s) served directly by the web server.
- **`src/`**: Core development directory.
  - **`assets/`**: Images and fonts referenced in pages.
  - **`content/`**: Media and content files (JSON/Markdown).
  - **`pages/`**: Defines site routes (e.g. homepage or custom pages).
  - **`translations/`**: Language files for internationalization.
- **`tailwind.config.mjs`**: Customizes [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) styles.
- **`package.json`**: Manages dependencies and scripts.
- **`astro.config.mjs`**: Configures LightNet and Astro settings.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript configuration for the project.

## Skills Needed to Work with LightNet

LightNet is designed to be approachable for users of all skill levels. However, having familiarity with the following areas will help you make the most of the platform:

### Core Skills

- **HTML and JavaScript**: Understanding the basics of these web technologies is helpful for customizing site layouts and interactivity. For learning resources, see [HTML Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) and [JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide).
- **Markdown**: Custom page content is managed in Markdown format. Familiarize yourself with Markdown using the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
- **JSON**: Configuration and content files are written in JSON. Knowledge of JSON syntax and structure is important for making edits. Refer to [JSON Basics](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).

### Framework and Tooling Knowledge

- **Astro Framework**: LightNet is built as an integration for Astro. Knowing Astro’s project structure and static site generation features will enhance your experience. Get started with the [Astro Documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/).
- **Tailwind CSS**: LightNet uses Tailwind CSS for styling. While not required, understanding Tailwind's utility-first approach can help you customize your site’s appearance. Check out the [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).
- **Git Basics**: Git is essential for managing content and collaborating effectively, especially when using the optional admin interface. Learn more in the [Git Handbook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics).
- **Command Line**: Familiarity with the command line will help you run build scripts, install dependencies, and manage your project efficiently. Start with this [Command Line Primer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line).
