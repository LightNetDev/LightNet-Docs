LightNet empowers communities to access curated media through a customizable, web-based distribution platform. Designed with accessibility and privacy in mind, it supports diverse content types such as books, videos, audio, and images, tailored to your audience's language and culture.

## Design Goals

LightNet is built with the following principles:

- **Reusable Solution**: Create media distribution sites with minimal coding.
- **Cost-Effective**: Keep operational expenses low for sustainability.
- **User-Friendly**: Simplify setup, modification, and maintenance.
- **Privacy-Focused**: Ensure no tracking or advertisements.
- **Multilingual Support**: Translate easily, including support for right-to-left languages.
- **Accessible**: Operate efficiently on low-bandwidth connections and older devices.
- **Secure**: Protect against common hacking attempts.

## How It Works

The **LightNet Library** transforms a folder of configuration files, content, HTML, and JavaScript into a fully deployable package of static assets (HTML, CSS, and JS).

Built as a plugin for the [Astro framework](https://astro.build), LightNet uses Astro´s static site generation capabilities to simplify media distribution. To get the most out of LightNet, we recommend exploring the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/).

### Key Features

- **Pre-rendered HTML**: Reduces traffic and improves load times.
- **Static Output**: Generates static files, removing the need for backend servers.
- **Flexible Content Management**: Edit content as JSON or [use an Administration UI](/content/admin-ui) that integrates with Git hosts such as [GitLab](https://gitlab.com).

With LightNet, you can create a robust, efficient media site to serve your community’s needs.

## Scope and Limitations

While LightNet is a powerful tool, it does not include:

- **User Authentication**: No built-in user accounts or access restrictions.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Integrate third-party tools for detailed tracking.
- **E-commerce Support**: Shopping carts and payment processing are not supported.
- **Complex Interactivity**: Server-side features like comments or personalized user experiences are unavailable.

These design choices keep LightNet lightweight and focused on its core purpose: static media distribution.

## Project Structure

LightNet projects follow the [Astro project layout](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/). Below is an example directory structure:

<FileTree>
- public/
- src/
  - assets/
  - content/
  - pages/
  - translations/
- tailwind.config.mjs
- package.json
- astro.config.mjs
- tsconfig.json
</FileTree>

### Directory Overview

- **`public/`**: Static files (e.g., PDFs, MP3s) served directly by the web server.
- **`src/`**: Core development directory.
  - **`assets/`**: Images and fonts referenced in pages.
  - **`content/`**: Media and content files (JSON/Markdown).
  - **`pages/`**: Defines site routes (e.g. homepage or custom pages).
  - **`translations/`**: Language files for internationalization.
- **`tailwind.config.mjs`**: Customizes [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) styles.
- **`package.json`**: Manages dependencies and scripts.
- **`astro.config.mjs`**: Configures LightNet and Astro settings.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript configuration for the project.



## Skills for Creating a Library with LightNet

LightNet is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, even for beginners. However, gaining familiarity with the following areas will help developers maximize its potential and customize the media library effectively.

<Aside>
A content administrator using the Administration UI does not need to learn these technologies. These skills are primarily for developers responsible for maintaining and enhancing a library.

### Essential Skills

- **HTML and JavaScript**: Basic understanding of web technologies allows you to customize site layouts and add interactivity. Explore [HTML Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) and the [JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide).
- **Markdown**: Page content is managed in Markdown, a lightweight and easy-to-learn format. Learn the basics with the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
- **JSON**: Configuration and content data is structured in JSON. Familiarity with JSON syntax helps you make precise edits. Check out [JSON Basics](https://learnxinyminutes.com/json/).
- **Astro Framework**: LightNet is built on the Astro framework. Understanding Astro’s project structure and static site generation features will greatly enhance your ability to work with the platform. Start with the [Astro Documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/).

### Recommended Knowledge

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling, offering a utility-first approach that simplifies customization. While optional, familiarity with Tailwind can help you refine your site’s appearance. Learn more at the [Tailwind CSS website](https://tailwindcss.com/).
- **Git Basics**: Git is a powerful tool for version control and collaboration. It’s especially helpful when configuring LightNet’s optional Administration UI. Get started with this [Git Guide](https://www.baeldung.com/ops/git-guide).
- **Command Line**: Many project tasks, such as installing dependencies or building your site, involve the command line. If you’re new to this, the [Command Line Primer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line) is a great place to start.

Even if you’re not familiar with these skills yet, LightNet’s beginner-friendly setup makes it easy to get started. As you grow your project, developing these skills will empower you to unlock advanced customization and functionality.
