title: Media Site Structure
---

This chapter introduces you to the structure of a media site built with LightNet from the
viewpoint of a site visitor. With this it explains LightNet's terminology that is used throughout the Docs.

{/* todo: link the terms to chapters that go more into depth */}

LightNet is all about sharing media content with a visitor. **Media content** can be videos, audios, images, 
literature, any other files or links to external websites. Media content is described by media items.
**Media items** contain metadata of the content like title, cover, authors, categories, description and links to the content.

## Visiting a typical LightNet Site

Visitors enter a LightNet site on the homepage. The customizable **homepage** welcomes them and offers
a selection of media items in a gallery view. On the top of the page visitors find a 
**header bar** that has the site title on the left and action icons on the right.

The three vertical lines icon (hamburg icon) opens the **main menu**.
The main menu enables navigation to other pages (of this site and external).
Next to the main menu users find the **language selection**. This menu lets visitors choose 
their preferred **site language**. Changing the site language navigates to an other page that
is in the selected language (it changes the locale). It might also affect the media items being presented.
The site language won't translate media items. For example the titles will not change with the site language.
Media Items have their own **content language**.

Clicking the magnifier icon brings the visitors to the **search page**. Here they can find media items by 
search queries or by filtering the content language, media type or categories.
Media types refer to different sort of media items for example "video" or "book".
Categories are a additional view on the items by topics such as "Theology" or "Life support".

Selecting a media item on the search page or on the homepage will navigate to the media item's **detail page**.
This page presents the media item with its metadata like title, cover.
It enables the visitor to directly view the content or navigate to the content by using its link.
