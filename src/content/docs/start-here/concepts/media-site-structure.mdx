This chapter introduces the structure of a media site built with LightNet from the viewpoint of a site visitor. Along the way, it explains key **LightNet terminology**, which is used throughout the documentation.

{/* todo: Link the terms to chapters that explain them in depth */}

## Understanding Media Content in LightNet

LightNet is designed for sharing **media content**, which can include these **media types**:

- Videos
- Audio recordings
- Images
- Text (e.g. articles, books, PDFs)
- Downloadable files
- Links to external websites

Each piece of media content is represented by a **media item**, which contains **metadata** such as:

- Title
- Media type
- Cover image
- Authors
- Categories
- Description
- Links to the content

## Navigating a LightNet Site

Visitors enter a LightNet-powered site through the **homepage**, a customizable landing page 
that welcomes them and displays a selection of media items in **gallery views**.

At the top of the page, they will see the **header bar**, which contains:
- The **site title** (on the left)
- Various **action icons** (on the right)

### Main Menu & Language Selection

The **main menu** (opened via the three-line "hamburger" icon) allows navigation to:
- Other pages on the same site
- External links

Next to the main menu, visitors will find the **language selection menu**, where they can choose their preferred **site language**. Selecting a different language changes the **locale**, meaning visitors are redirected to a version of the site in the selected language. However, this does **not** translate media items themselves—titles, descriptions, and other metadata remain in their original **content language**.

### About Page

The **About Page** is accessible from the main menu and provides visitors with key information about the site. This page typically includes:
- A brief **introduction** to the site’s purpose and mission.
- Details about the **organization** or individuals behind the media content.
- Guidelines on how users can **contribute**, **support**, or **get involved**.
- Contact information or links to related resources.

The About Page helps visitors understand the vision behind the site and how they can engage with its content.

### Searching for Media

Clicking the **magnifier icon** takes visitors to the **search page**, where they can:
- Search for media items by a search text
- Filter by **content language**, **media type**, or **categories**
    - **Content language** refers to the language in which a media item's content is presented, such as the written language of a book or the spoken language of a video.
    - **Media types** define the kind of content, such as "video" or "book."
    - **Categories** group media items by topic, such as "Theology" or "Life Support."

- The item's **metadata** (title, cover, authors, etc.)
- A way to **view the content directly** or navigate to it via external links.
