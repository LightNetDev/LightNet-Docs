## Design Goals

LightNet is built with the following principles:

- **Reusable Solution**: Create media distribution sites with minimal coding.
- **Cost-Effective**: Keep operational expenses low for sustainability.
- **User-Friendly**: Simplify setup, modification, and maintenance.
- **Privacy-Focused**: Ensure no tracking or advertisements.
- **Multilingual Support**: Translate easily, including support for right-to-left languages.
- **Accessible**: Operate efficiently on low-bandwidth connections and older devices.
- **Secure**: Protect against common hacking attempts.

## How It Works

A **LightNet** project transforms a folder of configuration files, content, HTML, and JavaScript into a fully deployable package of static assets (HTML, CSS, and JS).

Built as a plugin for the [Astro framework](https://astro.build), LightNet uses Astro's static site generation capabilities to simplify media distribution. To get the most out of LightNet, we recommend exploring the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/).

### Key Features

- **Pre-rendered HTML**: Reduces traffic and improves load times.
- **Static Output**: Generates static files, removing the need for backend servers.
- **Flexible Content Management**: Edit content as JSON or [use an Administration UI](/content/administration-ui) that integrates with Git hosts such as [GitLab](https://gitlab.com).

With LightNet, you can create a robust, efficient media site to serve your community's needs.

## Scope and Limitations

While LightNet is a powerful tool, it does not include:

- **User Authentication**: No built-in user accounts or access restrictions.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Integrate third-party tools for detailed tracking.
- **E-commerce Support**: Shopping carts and payment processing are not supported.
- **Complex Interactivity**: Server-side features like comments or personalized user experiences are unavailable.

These design choices keep LightNet lightweight and focused on its core purpose: static media distribution.
