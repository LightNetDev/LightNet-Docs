This chapter gives an high-level overview on how a media site using LightNet is built.
It explains the concept of static site generation and why this fits with LightNet's goals.

## Static Site generation

LightNet utilizes static site generation (SSG) to build media sites. 
SSG is the process of building a website by converting raw content (like Markdown, JSON, or YAML files) 
and templates into static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. This process involves:

1. **Content and Data**: The website content is stored in structured files.
2. **Templates**: Predefined templates or layouts determine the design and structure of each page.
3. **Build Process**: A build command processes the content with the templates to generate a complete set of static files.
4. **Deployment**: These static files can be directly served by any web server or distributed via a CDN.

LightNet uses SSG in order to:

- simplify the deployment process: While traditional sites need a running backend application, LightNet sites are just static files.
- increase site performance: Rendering of the pages is done during built time, doing this LightNet avoids rerendering with every page visit and minimizes the transmitted data.
- lower security risks: Since LightNet does not depend on a running backend application, it is more unlikely to be hacked.
- reduce maintenance tasks: Statically hosted files rarely crash, like backend applications do from time to time. This makes them more reliable.
- minimize cost: Hosting of static files is very cheap. You basically get it for free from some providers.


With SSG also comes limitations:
- no dynamic content: SSG will not support different permissions on media-items, it is not the solution to build highly interactive sites (chats, comments)

While LightNet focuses on providing a simple SSG approach it allows you to embed your dynamic components into your media site.


## How does LightNet help with SSG?

LightNet uses existing SSG tooling.
This how LightNet fits into the SSG process:

1. **Content and Data**: LightNet defines a data structure you build on. Data is stored in plain text files. This makes it easy to import and export to other systems.
2. **Templates**: LightNet comes with reusable layouts and building blocks. This radically increases development speed and simplifies building your media site.
3. **Build Process**: LightNet select state of the art tooling to transform data and templates into a static media site.
4. **Deployment**: LightNet will guide you with doing the deployment. Sites built with LightNet are infrastructure agnostic. This means you can deploy them anywhere. If you don't have an opinion on where to deploy, LightNet will give recommendations.
