LightNet is built on web technologies. While we strive to keep things simple, there are some essential tools you should be familiar with. This chapter introduces the core technologies LightNet is based on and provides resources to deepen your understanding when needed.

## Core Web Technologies

LightNet relies on standard web technologies that form the foundation of modern websites. Understanding these helps you navigate and customize your LightNet-powered site.

- **HTML (Basic Knowledge)** - A basic understanding of HTML structure is essential. Learn more in this [HTML Overview](https://web.dev/learn/html/overview).
- **JavaScript (Basic Knowledge)** - While LightNet doesn't require complex JavaScript, being [familiar with its syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website/Adding_interactivity) will be beneficial.
- **JSON (Good Understanding)** - Configuration and content data are structured in JSON. Knowing its syntax helps you make precise edits. Learn more with [JSON Basics](https://learnxinyminutes.com/json/).
- **Git (Basic Knowledge)** - Version control with Git is important for collaboration and managing changes, especially when configuring LightNet's optional Administration UI. Get started with this [Git Guide](https://www.baeldung.com/ops/git-guide).
- **Command Line (Basic Knowledge)** - You should know how to navigate directories and execute commands.

## Advanced Technologies

For more flexibility and customization, LightNet integrates with advanced frameworks built on top of core web technologies:

- **NPM (Basic Knowledge)** - Many project tasks, such as installing dependencies or building your site, are done via the command line using NPM. Learn more in the [Node.js docs](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/an-introduction-to-the-npm-package-manager).
- **Astro (Good Understanding)** - LightNet is built on the Astro framework. Understanding Astro's project structure and static site generation features helps you get the most out of the platform. Start with the [Astro Documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/).

Even if you're new to these technologies, LightNet's beginner-friendly setup makes it easy to get started. As your project grows, developing these skills enables deeper customization and more advanced functionality.
