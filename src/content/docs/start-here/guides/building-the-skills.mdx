title: Building the Skills
---

LightNet is based on web technology. Although we try
to minimize complexity, there is some tools you should know.
This chapter guides you through the technology that we are building on
and provides links to extending your knowledge, if needed.


## Basic Technologies

This is web standard technologies that LightNet is using.

- HTML (basic knowledge): You should have basic understanding of the HTML structure. We recommend reading this [overview on HTML](https://web.dev/learn/html/overview).
- JavaScript (basic knowledge): implementing a LightNet site, does not require you to write complex javascript. Although being [familiar with its syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website/Adding_interactivity) will help you.
- JSON (good understanding): Configuration and content data is structured in JSON. Familiarity with JSON syntax helps you make precise edits. Check out [JSON Basics](https://learnxinyminutes.com/json/).
- Markdown (good understanding): Page content is managed in Markdown, a lightweight and easy-to-learn format. Learn the basics with the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
- **Git** (basic knowledge) : Git is a powerful tool for version control and collaboration. It's especially helpful when configuring LightNet's optional Administration UI. Get started with this [Git Guide](https://www.baeldung.com/ops/git-guide).
- **Command Line** (basic knowledge): You need basics like how to navigate to a folder, to execute a command.

## Advanced Technologies

This is more advanced frameworks that build on top of the basic web technologies.
Good understanding of this tools will help you also.

- **NPM** (basic knowledge): Many project tasks, such as installing dependencies or building your site, involve the command line.
- **Astro** (good understanding): LightNet is built on the Astro framework. Understanding Astro's project structure and static site generation features will greatly enhance your ability to work with the platform. Start with the [Astro Documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/).
- **Tailwind CSS** (optional): Tailwind CSS is used for styling, offering a utility-first approach that simplifies customization. While optional, familiarity with Tailwind can help you refine your site's appearance. Learn more at the [Tailwind CSS website](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Even if you're not familiar with these skills yet, LightNet's beginner-friendly setup makes it easy to get started. As you grow your project, developing these skills will empower you to unlock advanced customization and functionality.
