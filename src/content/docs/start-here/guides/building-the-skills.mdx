### Essential Skills

- **HTML and JavaScript**: Basic understanding of web technologies allows you to customize site layouts and add interactivity. Explore [HTML Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) and the [JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide).
- **Markdown**: Page content is managed in Markdown, a lightweight and easy-to-learn format. Learn the basics with the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
- **JSON**: Configuration and content data is structured in JSON. Familiarity with JSON syntax helps you make precise edits. Check out [JSON Basics](https://learnxinyminutes.com/json/).
- **Astro Framework**: LightNet is built on the Astro framework. Understanding Astro's project structure and static site generation features will greatly enhance your ability to work with the platform. Start with the [Astro Documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/).

### Recommended Knowledge

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling, offering a utility-first approach that simplifies customization. While optional, familiarity with Tailwind can help you refine your site's appearance. Learn more at the [Tailwind CSS website](https://tailwindcss.com/).
- **Git Basics**: Git is a powerful tool for version control and collaboration. It's especially helpful when configuring LightNet's optional Administration UI. Get started with this [Git Guide](https://www.baeldung.com/ops/git-guide).
- **Command Line**: Many project tasks, such as installing dependencies or building your site, involve the command line. If you're new to this, the [Command Line Primer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line) is a great place to start.

Even if you're not familiar with these skills yet, LightNet's beginner-friendly setup makes it easy to get started. As you grow your project, developing these skills will empower you to unlock advanced customization and functionality.
