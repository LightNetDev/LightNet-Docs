Organize your media items by using categories to group them by topic. For example, you can create categories like "Theology", 
"Christian Living," and "Kids." Users can filter search results by these categories, making it easier to find relevant content. 
Categories are also essential for generating a gallery of media items on the homepage.
Categories show up on the search result items.

Here is an example of a category:

```json title="src/content/categories/theology.json"
{
  "label": "theology"
}
```
