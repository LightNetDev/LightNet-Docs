Use categories to group your media items by different topics. Eg. "Theology", "Christian Living", "Kids" could be categories that are referenced by media items. Your user can filter the search page by categories. Or you could use categories to query a list of media items to present them as a gallery on the homepage. 
Also categories show up on the search result items.

Here is an example of a category:

```json title="src/content/categories/theology.json"
{
  "label": "theology"
}
```

## Reference

A category is a JSON file that describes a category. The category identifier is its filename without the `.json` suffix. Here is the available properties.

### label

type: `string` \
example: `"theology"` \
required: `true`

The label is a the name of the category that shows up on the UI. The label can either be a fixed string or a translation key to support multiple locales. LightNet tries to lookup the translation with the key. 
If it does not find a translation with this key, it returns the key itself (this is how fixed strings work).
