title: DecapAdmin Config Reference

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";


LightNet Decap Admin is an Astro integration built on top of the [Decap CMS](https://decap-cms.org/) headless CMS.
You can configure the integration in your `astro.config.mjs` file.

```js title="astro.config.mjs" {8-10}
import lightnet from "lightnet";
import decapAdmin from "@lightnet/decap-admin";
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    lightnet({...})
    decapAdmin({
      languages: [{...}],
    }),
  ],
});
```

You can pass the following options to the `decapAdmin` integration:

### `languages`

type: `array` \
example: `[{ code: "en", label: "English", translations: {}, isDefaultSiteLanguage: true }]` \
required: `true`

The languages of your site. This is used to support multiple locales and content languages.
You should use the same languages as in the `lightnet` integration. We recommend creating a shared variable that is used in both integrations.
See the [lightnet configuration](#languages) for more information on the languages structure.

### `path`

type: `string` \
example: `"admin"` \
required: `false` \
default: `"admin"`

The path to the admin page.

### `imagesFolder`

type: `string` \
example: `"images"` \
required: `false` \
default: `"images"`

The name of the images folder next to your content files. Change this if you want to use a different name for the images folder.
For example if your images stored inside a folder `src/content/media/covers`, you can set this to `"covers"`.

### `backend`

type: `object` \
example: `{ name: "gitlab", repo: "your-org/your-site", appId: "12345abcd" }` \
required: `false`

This configures the git host that your Administration UI is connected to. Currently we support GitLab and GitHub backends.
The configuration directly maps (replacing snake_case with camelCase) to the Decap CMS [GitHub](https://decapcms.org/docs/github-backend) and [GitLab](https://decapcms.org/docs/gitlab-backend) backend configuration.

<Aside type="tip">
  We recommend using the GitLab backend for LightNet sites.
</Aside>

#### `backend: "gitlab"`

GitLab backend configuration has this options:

- **name**: `"gitlab"` (required) this selects the GitLab backend.
- **repo**: `string` (required) the GitLab repository path of your site.
- **appId**: `string` Application ID from the sites GitLab settings. Our [guide on the Administration UI](/content/administration-ui#connect-to-gitlab) shows how to get this.
- **branch**: `string` the branch that is used for the Administration UI. Default is `"main"`.
- **authType**: `"pkce"` the authentication type to use. Default and only option is `"pkce"`.

#### `backend: "github"`

GitHub backend configuration has this options:

- **name**: `"github"` (required) this selects the GitHub backend.
- **repo**: `string` (required) the GitHub repository path of your site.
- **branch**: `string` the branch that is used for the Administration UI. Default is `"main"`.
- **baseUrl**: `string` the URL of your service doing the authentication request.

<Aside>
GitHub does not support the PKCE authentication type. This means that you need an authentication server to handle the authentication request.
This is why we recommend using the GitLab backend for LightNet sites.

See the [Decap CMS documentation](https://decapcms.org/docs/backends-overview#using-github-with-an-oauth-proxy)
for more information on how to create an authentication server for GitHub.
