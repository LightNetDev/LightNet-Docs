All the media items of your LightNet site are described in JSON files. You find them in the `src/content` folder. It contains this types of content files:

- **media**: Each file in this folder describes a media item. This is the core of your LightNet site. Media Items
  will reference other content files like categories, collections. Learn more about [media items](/content/media-items).
- **media-types**: Media types are used to group media items by their type. Eg. "Video", "Audio" could be media types that are
  referenced. Also the media type will be used to determine the layout of the media item details page. Learn more about [media types](/content/media-types).
- **categories**: Categories group your media items by different topics. Eg. "Theology", "Christian Living", "Kids" could be
  categories that are referenced by media items. Learn more about [categories](/content/categories).
- **media-collections**: Media collections group media items that belong together. For example a video playlist
  could be modeled as a media collection. Other collection items will show up on the details page on a media item. Learn more about [media collections](/content/media-collections).

## Content Editing

You can edit the content files using your text editor. LightNet will automatically validate the structure of the content files.
If you have a syntax error in your content files, the LightNet development server will show you an error message in the console.

Alternatively you can use a Administration User Interface to edit the content files. This is also useful if you have non-technical users that want to edit the content. Learn more about the [Administration UI](/docs/administration-ui).
