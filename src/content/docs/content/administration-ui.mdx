LightNet enables you to manage your content using JSON files. This is great for developers, but not so much for non-technical users. That's why LightNet provides a Administration UI to manage your content with a user interface.
The interface will allow you to create, update, and delete media items and media collections.
We use a tool called [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/) to provide the Administration UI. It is a headless CMS that we configure to work with LightNet.

All changes made will be written to your file system or to your git repository if the user interface is used online.

## Add the Administration UI to your project

This is how you add the Administration UI to your LightNet project:

<Steps>
1. **Add Integration**: Add the LightNet Decap CMS integration using Astro's add command:
    ```bash
    npm run astro add @lightnet/decap-admin
    ```
    Confirm the questions with `y` to install required dependencies and add the integration to your `astro.config.mjs` file.
1. **Adjust Configuration**: Add your Administration UI configuration to Astro's `astro.config.mjs` file. This is a minimal 
    example:
    ```js ins={1-7,12,16}
    const languages = [{
      code: "en",
      name: "English",
      translations: {
        //...
      }
    }];

    export default defineConfig({ 
      integrations: [
        lightnetLibrary({
            languages: languages,
            //...
        }),
        lightnetDecapAdmin({
            languages: languages,
        })
      ]    
    });
    ```
    This adds a shared languages configuration to both the LightNet Library and the Administration UI. 
    The Administration UI will use the languages configuration to fill the language selection dropdowns for media items.


</Steps>

## Run the Administration UI

The Administration UI can write its changes to your local file system or to a Git Host like (GitLab or GitHub).

### Accessing your Local File System

Run your Administration UI on your local computer using npm scripts. 

<Steps>
1. In your Terminal execute this command from your project's root folder.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the LightNet development server. 
1. Open a new Terminal at the same location and execute:
    ```bash
    npx decap-server
    ``` 
    This will start a application that enables Decap CMS to access your file system. 
1. Navigate your browser to [localhost:4321/admin](localhost:4321/admin). You should see 
    the Administration UI showing you a list of your media items.
</Steps>

### Accessing a Git Host

The Administration UI also supports connecting to a Git Host like GitLab or GitHub.
A Administrator can access the UI on your website, all requests will be send to the Git Host's API.
Every change done on the Administration UI will change files inside your project using Git commits.
Authentication also will be handled by the Git Host, so only Persons you give access will be able to 
edit your page's content.

This architecture brings several advantages:
- No need to deploy and maintain a running server backend API.
- Security is handled by Git Host (with support for 2FA and more).
- Git History enables rollback and gives overview what has changed.
- Git repositories can be free of charge.

LightNet supports different Git Hosts. We recommend using GitLab as it supports Authentication from the 
User's Browser.

Here is how to configure LightNet Decap Admin to connect to a GitLab repository. For other Git Hosts please check
the [Configuration Reference](/reference/configuration).
