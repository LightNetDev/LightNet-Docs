title: Media Items

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';


Media items are the core of your LightNet Library. Each file in the `src/content/media` folder describes a media item. Media items will reference other content files like categories, collections, and media types.

Here is an example of a media item:

```json title="src/content/media/sermon-1--en.json"
{
  "commonId": "sermon-1",
  "title": "The Good Samaritan",
  "description": "A sermon about the Good Samaritan",
  "type": "video",
  "image": "./images/sermon-1-en.jpg",
  "categories": ["sermons"],
  "language": "en",
  "content": [
    {
      "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1234"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Aside>
By convention we name our files with the following pattern: `commonId--language.json`. This makes it easy to find the media item for a specific language.

## Media Item Structure

A media item is a JSON file that describes a media item. 
We recommend to fill as many properties as possible to provide a good user experience.
Here is a description of the available properties.

### commonId

type: `string` \
example: `"sermon-1"` \
optional: `false`

The `commonId` is a unique identifier for a media item. If your media item is available in multiple languages, 
you should create a media item for each language. In this case you should use the same `commonId` for all languages.
We use the `commonId` to find translations of a media item. By convention we name our files with the following pattern: `[commonId]--[language].json`.

### title

type: `string` \
example: `"The Good Samaritan"` \
optional: `false`

The title of the media item. The title should be in the language of the media item.

### language

type: `string`\
example: `"en"` \
optional: `false`

The language of the media item. The language should be a BCP-47 language code like `en`, `de`, `fr`.
The language will be used to filter media items by language and to display the media item in the correct language.
For every language used you need to provide a language definition in the `astro.config.mjs` file. The 
language will be referenced by the `code` property in the language definition. Add a new language definition like shown below. 
Notice that `translations` are not required when adding a language that is only a content language for media items and not a UI language.

```javascript title="astro.config.mjs" ins={5-8}
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    lightnetLibrary({
      languages: [
        {
          code: "en",
          name: "English",
        },
      ]
    })
  ]
})
```

### type

type: `string`\
example: `"video"` \
optional: `false`

This property defines the type of the media item. It will reference a file inside the `src/content/media-types` folder.
For example if you have a file `src/content/media-types/book.json` you can set the the `type` property to `book`.
The media type will be used to determine the layout of the media item details page.

### image

type: `string`\
example: `"./images/sermon-1-en.jpg"` \
optional: `false`

The path to the image file that should be used as a cover picture for the media item. The image should be in the `src/content/media/images` folder.
By convention we name our image files with the following pattern: `[commonId]--[language]`. If the image contains text, it should be in the language of the media item.
Provided image formats include `jpg`, `png`, `webp`. The image will be optimized for performance. We recommend to use a image that is at least 1000px wide to ensure that it looks good on all devices.

### content

type: `{ url: string, name?: string }[]`\
example: `[{url: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1234"}]` \
optional: `false` (at least one content object is required)

This references the actual content of the media item. For example this references a video on YouTube, or a file served from your server.
The `content` property is an array of objects. The first object in the array is considered to be the primary content of the media item.
The primary content is used for example with the embeded video player on the media item details page. All other content objects are considered to be additional content.
They will be displayed on the content section of the media item details page.

#### content.url

type: `string`\
example: `"/files/sermon-1.mp3"` \
optional: `false`

Each object should have a `url` property that points to the content. 
If you want to make a file available for your media item store it inside the `public/files` folder and reference it with the `url` property.
For example if you have a pdf file `public/files/sermon-1.pdf` you can reference it with the `url` property like this: `url: "/files/sermon-1.pdf"`.

This is urls that are supported:

- YouTube video urls like `"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1234"`
- Vimeo video urls like `"https://vimeo.com/1234"`
- Files served from your server like `"/files/sermon-1.pdf"`, we suppport all file types like pdf, mp3, mp4, etc.
- External files eg. from a CDN like `"https://cdn.example.com/sermon-1.mp3"`
- External websites like `"https://example.com/sermon-1"`


<Aside type="tip">
Use the `media-type` to configure how the content should be displayed. For example if you have a video you can configure the video player to be used.
Media types can add support for content urls that are not supported out of the box. Learn more about [media types](/content/media-types).
</Aside>

#### content.name

type: `string`\
example: `"Sermon 1"` \
optional: `true`

The `name` property is optional and can be used to give a name to the content. This name will be displayed on the content section of the media item details page.
If no `name` property is provided the name will be derived from the `url` property. For example if the `url` property is `"/files/sermon-1.pdf"` the name will be `sermon-1`.
If it is `"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1234"` the content name will be `youtube.com`.


### dateCreated

type: `string`\
example: `"2022-01-01"` \
optional: `false`

The date when the media item was created in this library. The date should be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. 
This date will be used to sort the media items from newest to oldest.

<Aside type="note">
The dateCreated is not the date when the media item was originally published. It is the date when the media item was added to the library.
</Aside>

### description

type: `string` \
example: `"A sermon about the Good Samaritan"` \
optional: `true`

A short description of the media item. The description should be in the language of the media item.
It can use Markdown syntax for formatting the text.

### authors

type: `string[]` \
example: `["John Doe", "Jane Doe"]` \
optional: `true`

A array containing the Author names of the media item.


### categories

type: `string[]`\
example: `["sermons"]` \
optional: `true`

An array containing the identifiers of the categories this media item belongs to. The category ids should match files 
in the `src/content/categories` folder. For example if you have a file `src/content/categories/sermons.json` you can set the the `categories` property to `["sermons"]`.

### collections

type: `{ collection: string, index?: number }[]`\
example: `[{collection: "sermon-series", index: 1}]` \
optional: `true`

An array containing references to collection this media item is contained in.
This is the properties of each collection reference object:

#### collections.collection

type: `string`\
example: `"sermon-series"` \
optional: `false`

Identifier of the collections this media item belongs to. It must match a collection definition inside 
the `src/content/media-collections` folder. For example if you have a file `src/content/media-collections/sermon-series.json` you can set the the `collections` property to `"sermon-series"`.

#### collections.index

type: `number`\
example: `1` \
optional: `true`

The index of the media item in the collection. The index is used to sort the media items in the collection. 
Entries with a lower index will be displayed first. Entries without index will be displayed after the entries with an index.
They will be sorted by their identifier.
