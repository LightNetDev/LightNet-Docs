All the media items of your LightNet site are described in JSON files in the `src/content` folder containing:

- [media](/content/media-items): Each file in this folder describes a media item. This is the core of your LightNet site. Media Items
  reference other content files like categories, collections.
- [media-types](/content/media-types): are used to group media items by their type. Eg. "Video" and "Audio" could be media types that are
  referenced. Also the media type is used to determine the layout of the media item details page.
- [categories](/content/categories): Categories group your media items by different topics. Eg. "Theology", "Christian Living", "Kids" could be
  categories that are referenced by media items.
- [media-collections](/content/media-collections): Media collections group media items that belong together. For example a video playlist
  could be modeled as a media collection. Other collection items show up on the details page on a media item.

<Aside>
This content folder is using [Astro's content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) feature.

## Content Editing

You can edit the content files using your text editor. Astro automatically validates the structure of the content files.
If you have a syntax error in your content files, the Astro development server shows you an error message in the terminal.

Alternatively you can use a [Administration User Interface](/content/administration-ui) (Administration UI) to edit the content files. 
This is also useful if you need to support non-technical users to edit the content.
