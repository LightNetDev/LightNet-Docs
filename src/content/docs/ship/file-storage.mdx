Cloudflare pages puts a limit of 25 mb on your file sizes. 
If you need to store bigger files we recommend using Backblaze.

Here is how to use it:

<Steps>
1. Create a Backblaze Account
1. Create a Backblaze Bucket and add your files
1. Reference your Backblaze URL with the media item's content url.
1. Set internal domains config inside `astro.config.mjs` to include your Backblaze domain.
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
We recommend keeping your file sizes as small as possible to provide a good user experience.
