Your LightNet Library can be hosted on any file server of your choice. To create a folder that can 
be deployed run from your project's root folder:

```bash
npm run build
```
This will create a folder named `dist`. This folder contains static html, css, js and assets to be put
on a webserver. Copy it to the file-server of your choice. 

If you do not have preferences on hosting you can choose our recommended setup (GitLab & Cloudflare Pages).

## Setup hosting on GitLab and Cloudflare Pages

We recommend using GitLab as the git repository host. This enables you to collaborate with others, also Cloudflare will use 
GitLab to read your source code and automatically release when there is new commits.

<Aside>
We prefer GitLab as a Git Host because it integrates well with the [Administration UI](/content/administration-ui).

Cloudflare Pages is recommended to deliver your website to your audience. 
It takes care of building your website on Cloudflare's servers, caching, distributing
your page around the globe (using Cloudflare's CDN) and more.

Both GitLab and Cloudflare Pages should be free of charge if your website does not turn into 
the next YouTube:

- Cloudflare's free plan includes unlimited requests to static pages.
- GitLab's free plan allows you to collaborate with up to 5 people inside a group.

### Configure a Cloudflare Domain

Cloudflare pages will provide you with a `.pages.dev` domain for free. If you need a custom
domain you can use Cloudflare domains to purchase a domain registration.
