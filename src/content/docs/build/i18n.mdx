title: Use Internationalization

LightNet comes with full support for internationalization (i18n). This allows you to create a multilingual site with ease. 
This guide will show you how to set up a new language, translate LightNet into a new language, and translate your own UI strings.

## Add a new UI language

Follow this steps to add a new UI language to your LightNet site:

<Steps>
1. **Add translations file**: Create a new file in the `src/translations` folder. The file should be named with the language code (e.g. `de.json` for German).
    The content of the file should look like this:
    ```json title="src/translations/de.json"
    {
        "hello-world": "Hallo Welt"
    }
    ```
    The left side of the colon is the key and the right side is the translation value.
1.  **Translate LightNet strings**: Some languages are already built-in to LightNet. Currently this is English and German. 
    If your language is not built-in add LightNet translations to the new file. All required keys can be found [here](https://github.com/LightNetDev/lightnet-library/blob/main/packages/library/src/i18n/translations/en.json).
    Translate the keys to your new language.
1. **Translate your own UI strings**: Add your own UI strings to the new file. More details on custom UI strings can be found [below](#use-custom-ui-strings).
1. **Add to config**: Add the new language to the `languages` array in your `astro.config.mjs` file.
    ```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={1} ins={7-11}
    import deTranslations from "./src/translations/de.json"

    export default defineConfig({
        integrations: [
            lightnetLibrary({
                languages: [
                    {
                        code: "de", // Language code must match the translation file name
                        name: "Deutsch", // Display name for the language selector
                        translations: deTranslations,
                    },
                ],
            }),
        ],
    })
    ```
1. **Set default (Optional)**: Set the new language as the default language by setting `isDefaultLocale: true` in the language object.
1. **Validate**: Run the development server with `npm run dev` and check if the new language is available in the language selector. Select the new language and check if the translations are working as expected.
</Steps>


## Use custom UI strings

Make sure they are distinct from LightNet's keys (all LightNet keys start with `ln.` to namespace them).
