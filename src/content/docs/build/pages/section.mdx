The `Section` component is used to create a section with a optional title. It takes care of the spacing
and the layout of its content. You can use a section to easily fit your custom component into the 
structure and design of your LightNet site. Its title is displayed above the section content in a well visible
font size.

You can add a section to your page by adding the following code:

```astro
---
import { Page, Section } from "lightnet/components"

const { t } = Astro.locals.i18n
---
<Page>
  <Section title={t("x.section.title")}>
    {/* Add components and HTML here */}
  </Section>
</Page>
```

## Reference

The `Section` component has the following properties:

### `title`

type: `string` \
example: `"My section title"` \
required: `false`

The title of the section. Is displayed above the section content.

### `maxWidth`

type: `"wide" | "narrow"` \
example: `"narrow"` \
required: `false` \
default: `"wide"`

A `Section` grows its width with the screen size. It stops growing according to the `maxWidth` property.
After this it is centered on the screen. The `maxWidth` property can be set to `wide` or `narrow`.

- `wide` (1280 px): this is used as the maximum width of the **homepage**. This section aligns
  to the left and right side of the header bar's content.
- `narrow` (768 px): this is used as the maximum width of the **details pages**.

### `id`

type: `string` \
example: `"my-section"` \
required: `false`

The id of the section. This can be used to link to the section e.g. `/en/about#my-section`.

### `marginTop`

type: `"sm"`|`"lg"`|`"none"`\
example: `"sm"`\
required: `false`\
default: `"lg"`

Sets the spacing between the section and the element above it. Possible are the following margins:

- `sm`: small spacing. Used on the details page.
- `lg`: large spacing. Used on the homepage.
- `none`: no spacing.

### `className`

type: `string` \
