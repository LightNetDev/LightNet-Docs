title: Add a Section
---

The `Section` component is used to create a section with a optional title. It takes care of the spacing and the layout of its content.

```astro
---
import { Section } from "lightnet/components"
---
<Section title={Astro.locals.i18n.t("x.section.title")}>
    {/* Add components here */}
</Section>
```

## Reference

The `Section` component has the following properties:

#### `title`

type: `string` \
example: `"My section title"` \
required: `false`

The title of the section.

#### `maxWidth`

type: `"full" | "prose"` \
example: `"prose"` \
required: `false` \
default: `"full"`

A `Section` will grow its width with the screen size. It will stop growing according to the `maxWidth` property.
After this it will be centered on the screen. The `maxWidth` property can be set to `full` or `prose`.

- `full`: The section will stop growing with the full width of the LightNet container. This will align
  the section to the left and right side of the header bar's content. The `full` width should be used on the homepage.
- `prose`: The section will stop growing so that contained text is still well readable. This is the width used on the details page.

#### `id`

type: `string` \
example: `"my-section"` \
required: `false`

The id of the section. This can be used to link to the section e.g. `/about#my-section`.

#### `className`

type: `string` \
example: `"py-4 bg-gray-100"` \
required: `false`

Additional css classes, separated by spaces, to style the section. The classes will be applied to the section's container element.
