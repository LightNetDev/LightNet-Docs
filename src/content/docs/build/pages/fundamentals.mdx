This chapter introduces how pages are created with LightNet. Most of the concepts presented are Astro concepts, we 
recommend using the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build) if you want dive deeper.

## Routing

The routes of your media site are defined by the files inside the `src/pages` folder.
The path within the `src/pages` folder directly maps to the route of the page. 
For example, a page at `src/pages/en/about.astro` is available at `https://your.site/en/about`.

In addition to the routes of the pages folder LightNet automatically adds:

- **Redirect to Homepage**: When users visit the root path of your site (`https://your.site`), they see the homepage in the default site language.
- **Search Page**: A page that displays all media items. This is on the `[locale]/media` route.
- **Details Page**: A page that displays the details of a specific media item. This is on the `[locale]/media/[id]` route.
- **404 Page**: A page that is displayed when a user tries to access a page that does not exist. This is on the `/404` route.


## Page Folder Structure

With LightNet every page (except `404` and `/`) is inside a folder defining its [locale](/build/i18n/fundamentals).
For example, the English version of the about page could be stored in `src/pages/en/about.astro`. 

There are two different types of locale folders: **static** and **dynamic**. You can use both inside the same project.

<Aside type="note">
Static and dynamic routes are a [Astro concept](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing/).

### Static Locale Folder

Create a separate folder for each locale. For example, `src/pages/en/` and `src/pages/de/`.
With this approach you can have a completely different structure for pages in different languages.
For example you could build an English homepage starting with gallery and a German homepage starting with a text.

We recommend using static locale folders:
- For rendering Markdown for different locales
- For high customization of pages according to locale

### Dynamic Locale Folder

Create one folder for all locales. This folder is used to create pages in all site languages.
To use a dynamic locale folder, create a folder named `src/pages/[locale]/` (Use exactly this name for the folder).
`[locale]` serves as a placeholder that is populated by Astro during the build process. Astro reads the 
possible values from a `getStaticPaths` function that must be exported by every Astro page inside this folder.
 
We offer a helper function to generate the static paths for all locales. Use it like this:


```astro title="src/pages/[locale]/some-page.astro"
---
export { getLocalePaths as getStaticPaths } from "lightnet/i18n"
---
```

<Aside type="tip">
If you need the locale of a page inside the dynamic locale folder, use `Astro.currentLocale`.
</Aside>

We recommend using dynamic locale folders for pages that have the same structure but need a different translations


## File layout

This is the basic layout of a LightNet page file:

```astro title="some-page.astro"
---
import { Page } from "lightnet/components"
---
<Page>
    {/* Add your content here */}
</Page>
```

The file is an Astro component. Everything inside the `---` is the frontmatter. 
It will be executed while your site is being built. Use this part to import your components and define your page's variables. 
For example query media items here.

Everything below the frontmatter is the actual content of the page. You can add any HTML here. We provide 
reusable components that you can use to build your page.

The `Page` component handles the layout of the page. This will add the header, language switcher, menu system... 
Wrap your page with this component to ensure that it is styled correctly.

Every component inside the pages folder maps to an HTML file in the output directory. 
The mapping will use the component's file name.
For example:

- `src/pages/en/index.astro` maps to `/en/index.html`
- `src/pages/en/about.astro` maps to `/en/about/index.html`
- `src/pages/en/info.md` maps to `/en/info/index.html` 

<Aside type="note">
Notice how Astro is generating `index.html` files. By web convention when opening a folder path in the 
browser the contained `index.html` is presented. Using this convention the helps simplify the paths of 
the website. E.g. the path is `https://your.site/en/about` instead of `https://your.site/en/about.html`.
