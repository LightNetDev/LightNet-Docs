LightNet will automatically generate this pages for you:

- **Homepage**: The first page that users see when they visit your site. This is on the `/` route.
- **Search Page**: A page that displays all media items. This is on the `/media` route.
- **Details Page**: A page that displays the details of a specific media item. This is on the `/media/:id` route.
- **404 Page**: A page that is displayed when a user tries to access a page that does not exist. This is on the `/404` route.

All other pages have to be added manually. This guide will show you how to add custom pages to your LightNet site.

## Understand the page folder structure

All pages are stored in the `src/pages` folder. The path within the `src/pages` folder will be the route of the page. For example, a file at `src/pages/en/about.astro` will be available at the `/en/about` route.

By convention all LightNet pages are stored in a folder with the locale code. For example, the English version of the about page would be stored in `src/pages/en/about.astro`. The locale code is used to infer the language of the page.

With Astro you have two options on how to name your locale folders:

- **static**: You can create a folder for each locale. For example, `src/pages/en/about.astro` and `src/pages/de/about.astro`.
- **dynamic**: You can use square brackets in the file name to create dynamic routes. For example, a file at `src/pages/[locale]/about.astro` will be available at the `/:locale/about` route. The `:locale` part will be replaced by the actual locale of the site. You need to export all available locales in the `getStaticPaths` function. We offer a helper function to generate the static paths for all locales. You can use it like this:

We offer a helper function to generate the dynamic paths for all locales. You can use it like this:

```astro title="src/pages/[locale]/about.astro"
---
export { getLocalePaths as getStaticPaths } from "lightnet/i18n"
---
```

Inside a component on dynamic path you can use `Astro.currentLocale` to get the current locale of the site.
