You can add a gallery of media items to your page. This is a great way to showcase your content.
LightNet provides a `Gallery` component that displays a grid of media items. Also it offers a 
`getMediaItems` function that you can use to query your media items.

Here is an example on how to use both:

```astro
---
import { Page, Section, Gallery } from "lightnet/components"
import { getMediaItems } from "lightnet/content"

const someEnglishBooks = await getMediaItems({
  where: { type: "book", language: "en" },
  orderBy: "dateCreated",
  limit: 10
})

const { t } = Astro.locals.i18n
---

<Page>
    <Section title={t("x.english-books.title")}>
        <Gallery items={someEnglishBooks} layout="book"/>
    </Section>
</Page>
```

Inside the frontmatter the `someEnglishBooks` variable is prepared. This will be executed only once when the site is built.
The `getMediaItems` function helps to query media items (Alternatively you could also use Astro's `getCollection` function to query media items). 
It takes a sql-like query object as an argument. 
The example filters for all media items that have the media-type `book` and the language `en`. 
It orders them by the date they were created (newest first) and limits the result to 10 items.

<Aside type="tip">
You can use Astro's `Astro.currentLocale` to query media items matching the current site language.

Use the `Section` component to layout your content. It adds spacing around your content, makes sure it is centered horizontally
and adds a title.

The `Gallery` component displays your media items in a grid. It shows the title and image of each media item. The number of grid columns depends on the screen width.
Pass your media items to the `items` property. Also choose a layout to define the appearance of the gallery.

### `layout`

to style the cover images. Available layouts are:

- `portrait`: Takes 2 to 5 columns. Use this for cover images that are portrait oriented.
- `book`: Takes 2 to 5 columns. This equals to `portrait` layout. Additionally a book fold is added to the cover image and corners are less rounded.
- `landscape`: Takes 1 to 4 columns. Use this for cover images that are landscape oriented.
- `video`: Takes 1 to 4 columns. This equals to `landscape` layout. Additionally all covers will have a aspect ratio of 16:9 with a black background.
