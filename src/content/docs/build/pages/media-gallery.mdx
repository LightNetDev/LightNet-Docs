You can add a gallery of media items to your homepage. This is a great way to showcase your content.
We provide a `Gallery` component that you can use to display your media items. Also we offer a 
`getMediaItems` function that you can use to query your media items. Here is an example on how to use both:

```astro
---
import { Page, Section, Gallery } from "lightnet/components"
import { getMediaItems } from "lightnet/content"

const someEnglishBooks = await getMediaItems({
  where: { type: "book", language: "en" },
  orderBy: "dateCreated",
  limit: 10
})

const { t } = Astro.locals.i18n
---

<Page>
    <Section title={t("x.english-books.title")}>
        <Gallery items={someEnglishBooks} layout="book"/>
    </Section>
</Page>
```

Inside the frontmatter the `someEnglishBooks` variable is prepared. This will be executed only once when the site is built.
The `getMediaItems` function helps to query media items (Alternatively you could also use Astro's `getCollection` function to query media items). It takes a sql-like query object as an argument.
We filter for all media items that have the media-type `book` and the language `en`. We order them by the date they were created (newest first) and limit the result to 10 items.

<Aside type="tip">
You can use Astro's `Astro.currentLocale` to get the current site language of the page. This can be useful if you want to query media items matching the current language.

Use the `Section` component to layout your content. It will add spacing around your content, make sure it is centered horizontally
and add a title. For multilingual sites you should pass a translated string for the `title` prop.

The `Gallery` component will display your media items. It will show the title and image of each media item.
Pass your media items to the `items` prop. Also choose a layout to define the appearance of the gallery. Use the [Components Reference](/reference/components#gallery) to learn more about the available layouts.

{/*todo: explain getMediaItems function*/}

## Reference

The `Gallery` component has the following properties:

#### `items`

type: `MediaItem[]` \
example: `const books = await getMediaItems({/*...*/})` \
required: `true`

The list of media items to display.

#### `layout`

type: `"book" | "video" | "portrait" | "landscape"` \
example: `"book"` \
required: `true`

The layout of the gallery. The layout will be used to determine the number of columns and
to style the cover images. Available layouts are:

- `portrait`: Takes 2 to 5 columns. Use this for cover images that are portrait oriented.
- `book`: Takes 2 to 5 columns. This equals to `portrait` layout. Additionally a book fold is added to the cover image and corners are less rounded.
- `landscape`: Takes 1 to 4 columns. Use this for cover images that are landscape oriented.
- `video`: Takes 1 to 4 columns. This equals to `landscape` layout. Additionally all covers will have a aspect ratio of 16:9 with a black background.
