title: Add a Highlight Section
---

If you have some content to highlight you can use the `HighlightSection` component. This component will display a large image with a title, 
a description and a optional link to another page. Here is an example on how to use it:

```astro
---
import { Page, HighlightSection } from "lightnet/components"
import highlightImage from "../../assets/highlightImage.jpg"
---
<Page>
    <HighlightSection
        image={highlightImage}
        title="Your Title"
        text="Some description"
        link={{
            href: "/some-page",
            text: "Link Text",
        }}
    />
</Page>
```

Make sure you add your image to the `src/assets` folder and import it at the top of the file. 
We recommend to use a image that is at least 1500px wide to ensure that it looks good on all devices. The 
image will be optimized for performance. Supported Image formats are `jpg`, `png`, `webp`.

For multilingual sites make sure to pass a translated string for the `title`, `text` props.
