## Creating Internal Links

If you want to create an internal link to a LightNet page. Make sure you always add the locale in front of the link.
For example this is how you can create a link to the about page inside a Astro component using JavaScript template strings:

```ts
`/${Astro.currentLocale}/about`
```

Additionally LightNet offers utility functions inside `lightnet/utils` to create paths:

- `detailsPagePath`: To build the localized path to a media item's details page
- `searchPagePath`: To build the localized path to the search page including preset filters.
