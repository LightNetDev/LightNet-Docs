title: Initialize Homepage

{/*Is "initialize homepage the right title - or are these actually the basics for every LightNet page?"*/}

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";


The homepage is the first page that users see when they visit your site. You can customize the homepage
to include a hero image, a call to action, a content gallery or add your own components...

The homepage is defined by the `src/pages/[locale]/index.astro` file. You can customize the homepage by editing this file.

## Basic file layout

This is the basic layout of the homepage's `index.astro` file:

```astro title="src/pages/[locale]/index.astro"
---
export { getLocalePaths as getStaticPaths } from "lightnet/i18n"
import { Page } from "lightnet/components"
---
<Page>
    {/* Add your content here */}
</Page>
```

The export of `getLocalePaths` is used to generate the static paths for the site. This will export all available locales for the site. You need this because the homepage is a localized page that will be translated into all available site languages.

Everything below the frontmatter is the actual content of the page. You can add any HTML here. We provide 
reusable components that you can use to build your page. More details below.

The `Page` component handles the layout of the page. This will add the header, language switcher, menu system... You should wrap your content with this component to ensure that your page is styled correctly.

<Aside type="tip">
The homepage file is using the Astro templating language. It is highly recommended to [learn more about Astro](https://astro.build/) to get a deep understanding of how to extend it.
