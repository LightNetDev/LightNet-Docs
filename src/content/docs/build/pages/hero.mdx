title: Add a Hero Section
---

The hero image is the first thing that users see when they visit your site. 
It is a large image that takes up the full width of the screen with a big centered title on top of it. 
You can add a hero image to your homepage by adding the following code:

```astro
---
import { Page, Hero } from "lightnet/components"
import heroImage from "../../assets/hero.jpg"

const { t } = Astro.locals.i18n
---

<Page>
    <Hero
        image={heroImage}
        title={t("x.hero.title")}
        subtitle={t("x.hero.subtitle")}
        titleSize="xl"
        subtitleSize="xl"
    />
</Page>
```

Make sure you add your image to the `src/assets` folder and import it at the top of the file.
We suggest to add a image that is at least 3000px wide to ensure that it looks good on all devices.
The image will automatically be optimized for performance.

If your site is multilingual, make sure pass a translated string for the `title` and `subtitle` props. Learn 
more about how to [use translations](/build/i18n).

Choose a font size for your title and subtitle according to their length. The available sizes are `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`.
The default for both sizes is `md`.
