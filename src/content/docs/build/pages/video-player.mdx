The `VideoPlayer` component is used to display a video on your page. To implement it, use the section component to fit 
the video player into your page structure like this:

```astro
---
import { Page, Section, VideoPlayer } from "lightnet/components"
import VideoImage from "../../assets/video-image.webp"

const { t } = Astro.locals.i18n
---
<Page>
  <Section title={t("x.video.title")}>
    <VideoPlayer 
        url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy4JA5uStB0"
        title={"UnusedTitleOnlyNeededByTheInterface?"}
        image={}
        />
  </Section>
</Page>
```
{/*todo: is title needed twice? why is always an image needed even when it is not used?*/}

<Aside type="tip">
We highly recommend using a video hosting platform like youtube or vimeo. Nevertheless it is also possible to host 
.mp4 videos yourself but be aware you might need an additional file server and it might slow down your site.

##VideoPlayer Reference

The `VideoPlayer` component has the following properties:

### `url`

type: `string` \
example: `"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy4JA5uStB0"` \
required: `true`

The source of the video that is shown. This can either be an external link to youtube or vimeo or a link to an 
mp4 file hosted on your server.

### `title`

type: `string`
example: `"Your Great Video"`
required: `true`

This title is only needed for the interface - if you want to set a title on top of the video use the `title` of the section.
{/*todo: is it possible to set the title optional? Or remove it completely when not used?*/}

### `image`

type: {/*where do i find this info?*/}
example: `import VideoImage from "../../assets/video-image.jpg"`
required: `true`

The image is used as a preview in case you use an mp4 video. {/*todo: is it possible to make the image optional?*/}
