title: Add Custom Components
description: How to build your own reusable components for your LightNet media site.

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"


You can also add your own components. All HTML, Astro and React components are supported.
Use Tailwind CSS to style your components (Tailwind CSS is not mandatory but highly recommended). 
Refer to the [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) documentation to learn more about how to create custom components.

<Aside>
LightNet might not be using the latest major version of Tailwind CSS, Astro, React... We follow those projects with some delay to 
make sure we do not break things. We advise when to update the dependencies in our release notes. To identify the dependency versions used by LightNet,
inspect the `package.json` file.

Here is an example on create a custom html section:


```astro
---
import { Page } from "lightnet/components"

const { t } = Astro.locals.i18n
---
<Page>
    <section class="bg-gray-800 py-12 mt-24 md:mt-28 text-gray-100">
        <div class="container mx-auto">
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center">{t("x.some.title")}</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-center">{t("x.some.description")}</p>
        </div>
    </section>
</Page>
```
