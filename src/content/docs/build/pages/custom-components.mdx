title: Add Custom Components

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"


You can also add your own components. All HTML, Astro and React components are supported.
Use TailwindCSS to style your components (TailwindCSS is not mandatory but highly recommended). 
Refer to the [Astro](https://docs.astro.build) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) documentation to learn more about how to create custom components.

Here is an example on create a custom html section:



```astro
---
import { Page } from "lightnet/components"

const { t } = Astro.locals.i18n
---
<Page>
    <section class="bg-gray-800 py-12 mt-24 md:mt-28 text-gray-100">
        <div class="container mx-auto">
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center">{t("x.some.title")}</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-center">{t("x.some.description")}</p>
        </div>
    </section>
</Page>
```

<Aside>
Because TailwindCSS uses features that are not yet widely available across browsers. LightNet
might not be using the latest version of TailwindCSS. To identify the version used by LightNet,
inspect the `package.json` file.
