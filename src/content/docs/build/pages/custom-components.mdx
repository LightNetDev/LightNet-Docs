import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"


You can also add your own components. All HTML, Astro and React components are supported.
Use Tailwind CSS to style your components (Tailwind CSS is not mandatory but highly recommended). 
Refer to the [Astro](https://docs.astro.build) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) documentation to learn more about how to create custom components.

<Aside>
Because Tailwind CSS might depend on css features that are not yet widely available across browsers. LightNet
might not be using the latest version of Tailwind CSS. To identify the Tailwind CSS version used by LightNet,
inspect the `package.json` file.

Here is an example on create a custom html section:


```astro
---
import { Page } from "lightnet/components"

const { t } = Astro.locals.i18n
---
<Page>
    <section class="bg-gray-800 py-12 mt-24 md:mt-28 text-gray-100">
        <div class="container mx-auto">
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center">{t("x.some.title")}</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-center">{t("x.some.description")}</p>
        </div>
    </section>
</Page>
```
