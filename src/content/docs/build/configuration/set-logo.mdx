title: Set a Logo
---

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";


The logo appears next to your site name in the header bar. It is optional, but recommended.
Set the path to an image inside the `./src/assets` folder (or a subfolder). Supported formats include `svg`, `jpg`, `png`, and `webp`.  
LightNet optimizes the image size for better performance. We recommend providing a image file with a width and height of 150px.

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={4}
// ...
lightnet({
  // ...
  logo: { src: "./src/assets/logo.png" },
});
```

<Aside>
  The logo will be scaled down to about 28x28px. Make sure it does not contain
  any text or small details.
