title: Set a Favicon
---

LightNet allows you to set an favicon (icon displayed in browser tabs and bookmarks).

#### Basic Method (Not Recommended)

The simplest way to set a favicon is by placing a `favicon.ico` file in your project's `public/` folder.  
This file will be served at `/favicon.ico`, a standard location recognized by all browsers.

#### Recommended Method

For a better user experience, use multiple icon formats tailored to different platforms. This approach ensures optimal display quality across devices. Reference the icons in your `astro.config.mjs` file as follows:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={4-18}
// ...
lightnet({
  // ...
  favicon: [
    {
      rel: "icon",
      href: "favicon.ico",
      sizes: "32x32",
    },
    {
      rel: "icon",
      href: "icon.svg",
    },
    {
      rel: "apple-touch-icon",
      href: "apple-touch-icon.png",
    },
  ],
});
```

#### Required Files

Place these files in your `public/` folder:

- **`favicon.ico`**: A fallback icon for all browsers. Recommended size: 32x32 pixels.
- **`icon.svg`**: A vector graphic for high-resolution displays. Ensure good contrast on light and dark backgrounds.
- **`apple-touch-icon.png`**: Used for home screen shortcuts on iPhones/iPads. Recommended size: 180x180 pixels.
