title: Set a Primary Color
---

LightNet allows you to customize the primary color to align with your ministry's branding.  
This color is used in various UI elements, such as the hover effect on the search magnifier icon in the header bar.

{/* primary color is now inside astro.config.mjs 
* Is it fitting to call it "primary color, when it is only used in two very small and spezial elements 
* (howering over the header-bar icons and a link-button in the highlight esction)?"
* At least I didn't find any other use of the "primary color"...

Replace `#14004B` with the hex color code of your choice.  
Ensure that the chosen color contrasts well against white backgrounds.
