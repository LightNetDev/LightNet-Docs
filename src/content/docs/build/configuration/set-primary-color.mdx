description: How to set the primary color for your LightNet Site.

LightNet allows you to customize the primary color to align with your site's branding.  
This color is used in some UI elements, such as the hover effect on the search magnifier icon in the header bar.

{/* also add tailwind.config.mjs to project structure*/}

Replace `#14004B` with the hex color code of your choice.  
Ensure that the chosen color contrasts well against white backgrounds.
