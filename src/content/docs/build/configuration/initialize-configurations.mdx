title: Initialize Configurations
---

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";


The primary configuration file for your LightNet project is `astro.config.mjs`. This file defines global configurations for your site, such as the title, languages, base URL, and more.

Below is a minimal `astro.config.mjs` file for a LightNet site:

```js title="astro.config.mjs"
import lightnet from "lightnet";
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";

export default defineConfig({
  site: "https://yourdomain.com",
  integrations: [
    lightnet({
      title: "Your Site's Name",
      languages: [
        {
          code: "en",
          label: "English",
          isDefaultSiteLanguage: true,
        },
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

This highlights essential settings for every site built with LightNet. Make sure you adjust them to match your ministry's needs:

<Steps>
1. **Site** - 
  The `site` property defines the base URL for your website. Update this to match your deployment URL.
   ```js
   site: "https://yourdomain.com"
   ```
1. **Title** - 
  The `title` property sets the title for your site, appearing in the browser tab and the header bar. You can set this to your ministry's or community's name.
   ```js
   title: "Your Site's Name"
   ```
1. **Languages** - 
  This setting defines the languages available on your site, including UI and content languages. Refer to the [Internationalization Guide](/build/i18n) and [Adding Media Items Guide](/content/media-items) for more details.  
  For the beginning, add your default language for the site:
   ```js
   languages: [
      {
        code: "en",
        label: "English",
        isDefaultSiteLanguage: true,
      },
    ]
    ```
    - **`code`**: Use your language's [IETF BCP-47 tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) (e.g., `es` for Spanish).
    - **`label`**: Display name for the language selector this can either be a fixed string (e.g., `Espa√±ol`) or a translation key (e.g. `x.languages.es`).
    - **`translations`**: Add custom translations for UI elements not covered by LightNet.  
      See the [Internationalization Guide](/build/i18n) for more information.
    - **`isDefaultSiteLanguage`**: Set this to `true` for exactly one language. This becomes the fallback language, used for missing translations or when users visit `/`.
</Steps>
