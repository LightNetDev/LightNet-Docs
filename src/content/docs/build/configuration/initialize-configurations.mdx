title: Initialize Configurations
---

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";


The primary configuration file for your LightNet project is `astro.config.mjs`. This file defines global configurations
for your site, such as the title, languages, base URL, and more.

Below is a minimal `astro.config.mjs` file for a LightNet site:

```js title="astro.config.mjs"
import lightnet from "lightnet";
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";

export default defineConfig({
  site: "https://yourdomain.com",
  integrations: [
    lightnet({
      title: "x.site.title",
      languages: [
        {
          code: "en",
          label: "English",
          isDefaultSiteLanguage: true,
        },
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

This highlights essential settings for every site built with LightNet. Make sure you adjust them to match 
your ministry's needs.

<Steps>
1. **Site** - 
  The `site` property defines the base URL for your website. Update this to match your deployment URL.
   ```js
   site: "https://yourdomain.com"
   ```
1. **Title** - 
  The `title` property sets the title for your site, appearing in the browser tab and the header bar. You can set this to 
  your site name. The title property accepts a fixed string or a [translation key](/build/i18n/todo). We recommend setting
  the title to a translation key for example `"x.site.title"`. By doing so you can change the title based on the curren site language.
   ```js
   title: "x.site.title"
   ```
   To change the value of the translation key use the translation files inside `src/translation`.
1. **Languages** - 
  This defines the languages available on your site, including site and content languages. Refer to the 
  [Internationalization Guide](/build/i18n) for more details on how changing languages. In the Sk8-Ministry example the 
  languages are declared as a variable in order to also pass them to the [Administration UI config](/content/todo). This is our recommended way
  to share the languages config between both integrations.
