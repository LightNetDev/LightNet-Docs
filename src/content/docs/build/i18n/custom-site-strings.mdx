LightNet allows you to add custom site strings to your site. This is useful if you want to add custom text to your site that is not part of LightNet.
Custom strings can be used for example to add custom text to the navigation or to add a text to the homepage.
Follow this steps to add custom site strings to your LightNet site:

<Steps>
1. Use your translations file from the previous chapter to add the custom site string as a key-value pair. For example 
    this is how you would add a custom string to the English translations file:
    ```yml title="src/translations/en.yml" ins={2}   
    x.hello-world: Hello World
    x.my-custom-string: My custom text
    ```
    Choose a unique key (left side of the colon) for your custom string. By convention all your keys should be prefixed with `x.`. LightNet's internal keys are prefixed with `ln.`. 
    This helps to avoid naming collisions and will improve the validation of your keys.
    The key will be used to referenced your custom string in your site. We recommend to use English keys for your custom strings.
2. Add the translation for your custom string to the other translations files. This is important if you want to support multiple languages.
   ```yml title="src/translations/de.yml" ins={2}
    x.hello-world: Hallo Welt
    x.my-custom-string: Mein eigener Text
    ```
    <Aside type="caution">
        Notice how the key is the same in all translations files. Keys must not be translated. Only the values should be translated.

3. Use the custom string in your site. We provide a translation function with `Astro.locals.i18n.t`. You can use this function to get the translation of your custom string.
    ```astro title="src/pages/[locale]/index.astro" {6}
    ---
    export { getLocalePaths as getStaticPaths } from "lightnet/i18n"
    import { Page } from "lightnet/components"
    ---
    <Page>
        <h1>{Astro.locals.i18n.t("x.my-custom-string")}</h1>
    </Page>
    ```
    The translation function will return the translation of the key `my-custom-string` in the current language.
    If the key is not found in the translations file, the function will return the value of the default translations file.
    If the key is not found in the default translations file, the function will throw an Error.
    <Aside type="tip">
        We provide internationalization helpers with the `Astro.locals.i18n` object. This object will additionally give you access to all 
        locales the defaultLocale and more. You can access the `i18n` object inside all your `.astro` files.
    </Aside>
    Some config options require you to pass the translation key instead of the translated string. For example the `title` property in the `astro.config.mjs` file.
    Check the [config reference](/reference/configuration) to see where a translation key is required.
