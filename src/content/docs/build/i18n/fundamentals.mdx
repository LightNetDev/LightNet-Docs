- How does LightNet implement Internationalization?
- What are design considerations on this
- Translation workflow?
    - translating own site
    - sharing translations with the LightNet project

## How translations are resolved

1. User translations are merged with built-in translations. User translations will override built-in translations.
2. Lookup translation key in exactly matching translation file
3. Lookup translation key in base language. E.g. for `en_US` this will use `en` to resolve the key.
4. Lookup translation key in fallbackLanguages defined for this language. Starting from first item. Stopping on first match.
5. Lookup translation key in default user-interface language. 
6. Lookup translation key in english translations
7. Return key if nothing is found. If key starts with `ln.` or `x.` throw an error.
