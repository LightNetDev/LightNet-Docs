use [this tool](https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/) to look up a new language's code.

Follow this steps to add a new site language to your LightNet site:

<Steps>
1. **Add translations file**: Create a new file in the `src/translations` folder. The file must be named with the language code (e.g. `de.yml` for German).
    The content of the file should look like this:
    ```yml title="src/translations/de.yml"
    # Your description of the translation.
    x.hello-world: Hallo Welt
    ```
    The left side of the colon is the key and the right side is the translation value. You may add a description by starting the line with `#`.
1.  **Translate LightNet strings**: Some languages are built-in to LightNet. This languages are maintained by the community. So it might be there is 
    missing translation.
    If your language is not built-in add LightNet translations to the new file. All required keys can be found [here](https://github.com/LightNetDev/lightnet/blob/main/packages/lightnet/src/i18n/translations/en.yml).
    Translate the keys to your new language. If you choose a built-in language your translations will override the internal translations.
    Please consider [sharing your LightNet translations with the community](#share-your-translations). 
1. **Translate your own UI strings**: Add your own UI strings to the file. More details on custom UI strings can be found [below](#use-custom-ui-strings).
1. **Add to config**: Add the new language to the `languages` array in your `astro.config.mjs` file.
    ```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={5-13}
    export default defineConfig({
        integrations: [
            lightnet({
                languages: [
                    {
                        // Language code must match the translation
                        // file name. For example "de.yml" has the code "de"
                        code: "de",
                        // Display name for the language selector.
                        label: "Deutsch",
                        // Use this as a site language
                        isSiteLanguage: true
                    },
                ],
            }),
        ],
    })
    ```
1. **Set default language (Optional)**: Inside `astro.config.mjs` set the new language as the default language by setting `isDefaultSiteLanguage: true` in the language config object.
1. **Validate**: Run the development server with `npm run dev` and check if the new language is available in the language selector. Select the new language and check if the translations are working as expected.
