Follow this steps to add a new site language to your media site:

<Steps>
1. **Identify the language's BCP-47 code**: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag), [this tool](https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/), google or chat-gpt might be helping you with this. E.g. `en` for English.
1. **Create translations file**: Create a empty file in the `src/translations` folder. The file must be named with the language code ending with `.yml` (e.g. `en.yml` for English).
1. **Find out if LightNet already offers your language**: Open LightNet's [built-in translations on GitHub](https://github.com/LightNetDev/LightNet/tree/main/packages/lightnet/src/i18n/translations).
    See if there is a file named `[your language code].yml`.
        - If there is no such file, LightNet does not yet offer built-in translations for your language. In this case you can add translations inside your project (see explanation below).
        - If there is a translation file for your language, checkout the [Translation-Status](https://github.com/LightNetDev/LightNet/blob/main/packages/lightnet/src/i18n/translations/TRANSLATION-STATUS.md) 
          to see if there are missing keys for your language.  
1. **Add LightNet translations to your project**: If your language is not yet built-in, or if the built-in translation file is missing keys you need to add these keys to your
    translation file. To do so, copy all missing entries from the [English translation file](https://github.com/LightNetDev/LightNet/blob/main/packages/lightnet/src/i18n/translations/en.yml) 
    to your newly created translation file (from step 2). Translate the values to your language.
1. **Add your custom site strings**: If you already have other translation files that define custom site strings (keys starting with `x.`), add them to your new translation file.
1. **Add language to config**: Add the new language to the `languages` array in your `astro.config.mjs` file.
    ```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={5-12}
    export default defineConfig({
        integrations: [
            lightnet({
                languages: [
                    {
                        // BCP-47 code from step 1
                        code: "de",
                        // Display name for the language selector.
                        label: "Deutsch",
                        // Use this as a site language
                        isSiteLanguage: true
                    },
                ],
            }),
        ],
    })
    ```
1. **Set default language**: Your pages needs exactly one default site language. 
    If you want to use the new language as the default site language, replace `isSiteLanguage: true` with `isDefaultSiteLanguage: true`.
1. **Validate**: Run the development server with `npm run dev` and check if the new language is available in the language selector. 
    Select the new language and check if the translations are working as expected.
