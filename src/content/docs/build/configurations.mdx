LightNet provides flexible configuration options to tailor your site to your specific requirements.  
This guide gives an overview of the primary configuration file, `astro.config.mjs`, and walks you through essential settings. It also explains how to solve basic configuration tasks, like setting up the main menu.

## `astro.config.mjs` Overview

The primary configuration file for your LightNet project is `astro.config.mjs`. This file defines global settings for your site, such as the title, languages, base URL, and more.

Below is a sample `astro.config.mjs` file showcasing how to set up a basic LightNet project:

```js title="astro.config.mjs"
import lightnetLibrary from "@lightnet/library";
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";

export default defineConfig({
  // Base URL of your site
  site: "https://yourdomain.com", 
  integrations: [
    lightnet({
      // Title displayed in the site's header and metadata
      title: "Your Ministry Name", 
      
      // Path to your site's logo, displayed alongside the title
      logo: { src: "./src/assets/logo.png" }, 

      // Supported languages for the site, with codes and optional translations
      languages: [
        {
          code: "en", // ISO code for English
          label: "English", // Display name for the language selector
          translations: {}, // Placeholder for custom UI translations
          isDefaultLocale: true, // Default language for the UI
        },
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Basic Settings

The example highlights essential settings for every site built with LightNet.  
Make sure you adjust them to match your ministry’s needs.


#### 1. **Site URL**

The `site` property defines the base URL for your website. Update this to match your deployment URL.

```js title="astro.config.mjs" {2}
defineConfig({
  site: "https://yourdomain.com",
})
```


#### 2. **Site Title**

The `title` property sets the title for your site, appearing in the browser tab and the header bar.  
You can set this to your ministry’s or community’s name. It can be a fixed string or a translation key to support multiple locales.

```js title="astro.config.mjs" {2}
lightnetLibrary({
  title: "Your Ministry Name",
});
```


#### 3. **Site Logo**

The logo appears next to your site name in the header bar.  
Set the path to an image inside the `./src/assets` folder (or a subfolder). Supported formats include `svg`, `jpg`, `png`, and `webp`.  
LightNet optimizes the image size for better performance.

```js title="astro.config.mjs" {2}
lightnetLibrary({
  logo: { src: "./src/assets/logo.png" },
});
```


#### 4. **Languages**

This setting defines the languages available on your site, including UI and content languages.  
Refer to the [Internationalization Guide](/build/i18n) and [Adding Media Items Guide](/content/media-items) for more details.  

To start, add your default language for the user interface:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" {2-11}
lightnetLibrary({
  languages: [
    {
      code: "en", // Language code for English
      label: "English", // Display name for the language selector
      translations: {
        // Add custom UI translations here
      },
      isDefaultLocale: true, // Set this as the fallback language
    },
  ],
});
```

- **`code`**: Use your language's [BCP-47 tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) (e.g., `es` for Spanish).
- **`label`**: Display name for the language selector this can either be a fixed string (e.g., `Español`) or a translation key (e.g. `custom.languages.es`).
- **`translations`**: Add custom translations for UI elements not covered by LightNet.  
  See the [Internationalization Guide](/build/i18n) for more information.
- **`isDefaultLocale`**: Set this to `true` for exactly one language. This becomes the fallback language, used for missing translations or when users visit `/`.

## Common Configuration Tasks

This guide explains how to solve common configuration tasks with LightNet.  
For advanced use cases, refer to the full [Configuration Reference](/reference/configuration).

---

### Set an Icon (Favicon)

LightNet allows you to set an icon (favicon) displayed in browser tabs and bookmarks.

#### Basic Method (Not Recommended)

The simplest way to set a favicon is by placing a `favicon.ico` file in your project's `public/` folder.  
This file will be served at `/favicon.ico`, a standard location recognized by all browsers.

#### Recommended Method

For a better user experience, use multiple icon formats tailored to different platforms. This approach ensures optimal display quality across devices. Reference the icons in your `astro.config.mjs` file as follows:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" {2-16}
lightnetLibrary({
  favicon: [
    {
      rel: "icon",
      href: "favicon.ico",
      sizes: "32x32",
    },
    {
      rel: "icon",
      href: "icon.svg",
    },
    {
      rel: "apple-touch-icon",
      href: "apple-touch-icon.png",
    },
  ],
});
```

#### Required Files

Place these files in your `public/` folder:

- **`favicon.ico`**: A fallback icon for all browsers. Recommended size: 32x32 pixels.
- **`icon.svg`**: A vector graphic for high-resolution displays. Ensure good contrast on light and dark backgrounds.
- **`apple-touch-icon.png`**: Used for home screen shortcuts on iPhones/iPads. Recommended size: 180x180 pixels.

#### Understanding Favicon Settings

Each entry in the `favicon` array maps to an HTML `<link>` element. For example:

Input:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" {2-8}
lightnetLibrary({
  favicon: [
    {
      rel: "icon",
      href: "favicon.ico",
      sizes: "32x32",
    },
  ],
});
```

Output:

```html {2}
<head>
  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico" sizes="32x32" />
</head>
```

<Aside> 
LightNet automatically determines the `type` attribute based on the file extension in the `href`.

### Configure the Main Menu

LightNet supports adding a main menu in the header bar, displayed as a hamburger icon on smaller screens.  
The menu can link to internal or external pages, such as the home page, search, or about sections.

Here’s an example configuration:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" {2-19}
lightnetLibrary({
  mainMenu: [
    {
      href: "/",
      label: "ln.home.title",
    },
    {
      href: "/media",
      label: "ln.search.title",
    },
    {
      href: "/about",
      label: "custom.navigation.about",
    },
    {
      href: "https://www.another-ministry-site.com",
      label: "Another Ministry",
    },
  ],
});
```

#### Menu Item Properties

- **`href`**: Defines the link destination. It can be relative (e.g., `/media`) or absolute (e.g., an external URL).  
  External links will open in a new browser tab.
- **`label`**: The text displayed on the menu item. Use a translation key for localization or a fixed string for non-localized labels.  
  Learn more about translation keys in the [Internationalization Guide](/build/i18n).

<Aside>
Relative URLs are automatically prefixed with the current locale (e.g., `/media` becomes `/en/media` for English).  
To disable this, add the `requiresLocale: false` property to the menu item.
</Aside>



### Change the Primary Color

LightNet allows you to customize the primary color to align with your ministry's branding.  
This color is used in various UI elements, such as the hover effect on the search magnifier icon in the header bar.

Update the primary color in the `tailwind.config.mjs` file. For example:

```js title="tailwind.config.mjs" {5}
import { lightnetStyles } from "@lightnet/library/tailwind.config.ts";

export default {
  presets: [
    lightnetStyles({ primaryColor: "#14004B" }),
  ],
};
```

Replace `#14004B` with the hex color code of your choice.  
Ensure that the chosen color contrasts well against white backgrounds.
